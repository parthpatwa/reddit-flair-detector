ive never seen or met the ambassador what is happening?she explains that my oci file number could not be retrieved in the system because the application was submitted in 2018  and because its currently 2019  there were crossed wires  thus resulting in their inability to take my fingerprints and give me my oci  my wife and i make the suggestion of taking physical ink fingerprints at the local police station and  bringing them back to the embassy  so they can have a hard copy she said that the ink fingerprint option is not possible and reiterates that the best solution  as per the advice of the ambassador who wasnt in a good mood  would be to fill out and pay for a new application back to square one  11 months down the drain we are confused  just drove 7 hours at her request to pick up this card only to tell us to our face that we cant have it and we need to start again  we politely try to press her for more information  and the best option she has for us  was for her to email a request to her oci contacts in india to try to resolve this by issuing a new file number and a new card  but not to be optimisticwhat is going on here? any advice would be much appreciatedi  should also add that i am canadian living in europe  a qualified  professional in interaction design  educated  and dont have a criminal record,FrustratedOCIHopeful, honestly  she and her supervisor behaved exactly how most of our government officers behave with residents of india inside india  they typically do such things to extract a bribe i cant say for sure if she has the same expectation#x200b one option you have  if oci matters so much to you  is to tweet your problem directly to indias foreign minister  sushma swaraj she is supposed to be proactive about such things  especially when it comes to matters like these where they like to project a good  but false  image of our government  and tweeting to her in front of millions of followers basically forces her hand into helping you also  pulling strings this way by bringing in somebody influential to get what you want is very much the indian way  and since you wish to become a quasicitizen of india  you might as well start learning our bad habits#x200b i  personally  am not a big fan of kowtowing to influential people or to our government officials i wouldnt have gone for an oci to begin with  and if i absolutely had to for some reason  id try it once and drop the idea once it turned out to be too hard you have already sunk enough costs for a card that is of little benefit i suggest dropping the idea entirely as a canadian  i dont think youll have any trouble getting multiple entry tourist visa for frequent visits this lady sounds full of shit why would an ambassador concern himself herself with oci affairs? even if she isnt lying  its worth emailing the consulate embassy politely explaining the situation and ccing the ambassador if you can find their email if there are multiple consular missions in the country  try emailing them as well tweet a summary with some details to sushma swaraj   she has helped ppl in similar situations hi  im sorry to hear that you had to go through this youd think these people would adapt to the local work culture ethic but it seems they are pushing their work culture and ethic on the locals  which shouldnt be the case#x200b please tweet your issue to the minister of external affairs   https  twittercom sushmaswaraj?ref_srctwsrc5egoogle7ctwcamp5eserp7ctwgr5eauthor  https  twittercom sushmaswaraj?ref_srctwsrc5egoogle7ctwcamp5eserp7ctwgr5eauthor  #x200b make sure its public and that her twitter is tagged in your post she is very well known to bring visa officers in line when they refuse to carry out their duty do keep us posted about things you did for this issue if it is just for a visit  apply for a regular visa you can always visit india as a tourist as regards your oci card application  tweet or send a message to the external affairs minister sushma swaraj with your experience probably you are lying in fine details  or it is shitpost or karma whoringas an official  one can certainly say that  an ambassador is too busy to deal with  we drive 7 hours to the embassy  getting pumped up to an audiobook set in india  yes  were nerds  r iamverysmart individuals  moreover  if any of the official encounters technical problems  it is impossible for them to say cannot be done because of bad mood   an embassy is not your regular post office branches the productivity level despite being in perpetual shortage of stuff is inspiring for all other government branches  if you have any kind of proof about your claims of misbehaviour get out of anonymity  go for appropriate mechanism    if you dont know the mechanism  pm me your proof  i will provide you,2019-04-16 02:11:42

AskIndia,what happened to the spiritual country that india used to be?,23,ai7392,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ai7392/what_happened_to_the_spiritual_country_that_india/,17,so i do not know whether to put this in ask india  because it is a question  or reddiquette  because it is a discussion in and of itself  but i wanted to discuss this with someone  anyone  so ours is  used to be?  a spiritual country off the top of my head  i can recall at least 4 major religions that began here hinduism  buddhism  jainism  sikhism who knows  there are probably more that i dont know about and at the core of these religions  irrespective of how the religions followers have interpreted things  these religions are supposed to be about good about being nice  kind  compassionate  loving  forgiving  the prevalent view in india about the west and people from western countries is that those guys are materialistic and we are somehow more spiritualistic i couldnt disagree more  rather  i see the values and virtues of simple kindness  love  nicety  acceptance  love and certain other socalled spiritual virtues on the rise far more amongst the western world than in india it is not like people are rising up in arms against ideas such as racism  sexism and homophobia for no reason in the west indians  meanwhile  are still dealing with the supreme court ruling legaylising gay relationships while kids in the western worlds are growing up being more accepting of kids from a different economical background than theirs  or someone who has gay lesbian parents  or someone who has anxiety issues or whathaveyou  we in india are drumming up noise about what ancient india achieved in terms of scientific advances and how our indian culture is above all and everyone else is somehow beneath us  now dont get me wrong here  i am not trying to say that the west is perfect and that all indians are all dicks or anything like that indians  outside of the major metroes  are still some of the most kind and helpful people that ive met  so long as you dont discuss things that will piss them off eg religion  caste system etc and yes  the west has a long way to go before they become all accepting  just look at the maga crowd and the whole feminist cult but that having been said  i really wonder why we as a country are not waking up to the fact that we are becoming evil day by day  ironically  while attempting to tell the world how good and virtuous our ancient civilization is  while the ones we have vilified as the ignorant western people are slowly leaving us behind  much like the tortoise in the tortoise hare story  just a little something for everyone to think about on a regular monday morning cheers  edit and it is surprising that while so many whatsapp forwards talk about how india had the best vimanas  spacecrafts  or the best brahmastras  weapons equivalent to a nuke   nobody  like literally not one single whatsapp forward talks about how humility  kindness  forgiveness  acceptance etc were the  supposed  virtues of people from that time period perhaps promoting such virtues in our current world is not seen as cool enough by the people who forward these forwards? i dunno but it fails me how having a personal flying ship is somehow more important than basic love and kindness towards one another,fenocs, it all starts with the relationships we have with our families  the education we get and the amount of time we join our brethren in discussions reflections on life  having a healthy appreciation for the achievements of our ancestors and using them as an inspiration to work towards a progressive future would be a great way forward india is a ritualistic country  has always been spiritual places people do exist in himalayas  varanasi  arunachal ashrams etc and they still in full glory your position is too simplistic its the kind of logic one would see on a meme first of all  this idea of claiming certain traits is not unique to india america claims freedom for example some japanese have tried to argue how the japanese outlook on beauty is different than that of the rest of the world the germans claim industriousness  the chinese stability and order and so on these are ideals  but not defensible under a court of law nobody should be tallying up points to prove or disprove any of these because it is a meaningless exercise  meant only to attack how a country sees itself  and it will win you no favours  however right you may be next  you dont factor in how much of this spirituality is a direct counter to western colonialism and market imperialism even a casual look at indian history does not convince me that spiritualism is a major feature of most kingdoms or empires in the subcontinent not that the bhakti movement  the sufi movement  the virasaivites etc did not exist  but that they were quite often not the defining feature of indian politics or active life where you see the mystical india emerge is in british writing  and later indian writers  politicians and reformers trying to separate india from western civilization as late as 1810  india accounted for nearly 25 of international trade and quite a lot of global gdp i doubt spiritualism was at play here moreover  this talk of spiritualism is also often used to silence the active role indians have played in history its far easier to think of a quiet  backward and peaceful nation of mystics slipping behind the west because they focused on spirituality and not on technology the far more complicated truth is conveniently left out and finally  is it all that love and kindness  in the west that has had them bomb every country between saudi arabia and india? is it love that has allowed the us president to call africa a continent of shithole countries and ban immigration from muslim countries? even regarding social liberalization  is it love that made the us push abstinence only sex education and preach against the use of condoms in africa during the hiv crisis? is it kindness to continuously threaten to restrict access to abortion for women? ban burkinis? call migrants fleeing terror and war swarms as if they were pests? in the words of the black eyed peas where is the love?your view is either myopic or bigoted  in that either you receive restricted and biased information or you are far more forgiving of western countries than india the truth  of course  is that india is also becoming more socially liberal only time will tell  once indians are as wealthy as americans what the social landscape in india will look like heres the thing in my lifetime ive only seen it get better i dont even defend this characterization of india as a spiritual place india is anything but spiritual for most indians who actually live there its the foreign eatpraylove crowd  doing hot yoga and sipping yerba mate tea who see india as this mystical place sort of like the beatles and india in response capitalized on it to me  it is a foreign import but if thats what india wants for the future  i think they can go for it again  i dont think for one minute india is a better place for the average trans person than the us today  but you imply that by virtue of spiritualism and kindness and love  we should be  and thats just wrong  religion existed as means to control societies it kept people within tribal groups gave them a code of behaviour and roles to play it made sure the oppressed never questioned why they were opppressed and the weak to be happy with their lot with hope for future rewards plus it helped explain phenomenon they did not understand now we understand almost everything and can come up with scientific and logical explanation for most phenomenon we follow rule of law and secular philosophy rather than religion to dictate our morals we dont need religion really now its only a crutch for the weak minded and people who are in a bad position in life  spiritualism was once indeed an aspect of indian culture that generation is long gone today  spiritualism in the indian context is more of a feelgood consolation prize  hey we might be losers  but we are spiritual  in reality  we have become way more worldly and materialistic than some western societies bc khaane ko paise nahi  rehne ko room nahi  peene ko daaru nahi  aur babu rao ko sukoon nahi aur tum sprituality ki baatan karte religious and materialistic are not opposites of each other like you make it sound religious texts and behavior is the singlemost biggest reason for people being homophobic sexist etc these texts outline what sexuality is right and what is not what a girl or a boy is supposed to do and what not if only people can think and have empathy on their own without needing random holy texts we wouldnt have so many problems in the first place  communal politics  its an irrelevant comparison as you are not taking countryspecific factors into account1  the west is economically developed vs india and has at least 30 years of a headstart any society will automatically try to cure itself of its evils once your basic amenities and infra are taken care of2  no other country is as diverse as india  religion  language  food  culture  race  caste you name it and india has it now i have nothing against diversity  but from a social perspective  it does put us at a disadvantage as politicians can continue to target specific vote banks without focusing on economic development consequently  when there is no economic progress  social progress is hard to achieve3  you might underplay the importance of gay sex legalization  but there has been a real change in mindset  at least in the urban areas this is tangible social progress and it was unimaginable 2030 years back even when you look at the usa  not every state has legalized gay marriagebtw  what is your definition of evil?

AskIndia,clueless american food etiquette with our indian neighbors,55,bemcxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bemcxg/clueless_american_food_etiquette_with_our_indian/,24,id initially posted this to r askindia and got some advice  but i was also directed to post this here too my main goal is to avoid any inadvertent rudeness on our familys part  so we have some neighbors from india  were in the us  and they have a daughter around the same age as ours  preschool  the two girls have become good friends and play together several times a week whenever their daughter comes over to our house  she brings a snack with her  and politely declines anything we offer her while shes here  theyre catholic  and do not have any dietary restrictions from what theyve told us  which is usually fruit or crackers  never junk food whenever our daughter goes over to their house  she always comes back with food of some sort sometimes its a small snack  sometimes its something more elaborate theyve also brought us food on a couple occasions too  always delicious  weve had them over for a meal a few times  and they eat sparingly#x200b my impression is that they just dont enjoy western food  which is completely fine but i want to make sure were not somehow being rude growing up  if i went over to a friends house  their parents would give us snacks drinks similarly  if friends came over to my house  my parents would offer food drinks but should we be sending our daughter over to their house with her own snack? when we cook something special  should we bring some to them? i just want to make sure were being good considerate friends,JaJH, you can directly ask them if it would be ok to offer their kid some food and if it is what things need to be considered  like any allergies  etcalso  their not eating much might be their food preferences might not like weatern food  or maybe theyre shy   many indians are shy when they are eating at someone whos not close  i dont have an answer to your question  but i just wanted to say thanks for making the effort to learn and understand a new different culture if everyone was like you  the world would be an amazing place ive been living in the us for nearly two years now  indian national   and i can see some similarities with my upbringingfirst  their kid bringing snacks to eat at your house is kind of weird  but not reallyindians have this whole thing where they tend to refuse something that is offered to them once or twice  even if they want it but its way more simpler with americans if youre eating a bag of chips and offer some to an american  theyll take it if they want it  or refuse but if you offer some to an indian  they might refuse the first time this means that they are waiting on you to offer it once again  so they know that you really meant it when you offered it  and youre not just offering it for the sake of doing sothis explains how they send food over with your daughter  but eat sparingly when theyre over for dinner at your house they probably refuse seconds because of thisits definitely not something youre doing wrong its just the way we are wired if they didnt like you or were offended they would interact with you or your family that muchthe next time they refuse food  just plop some on their plate regardless and see if theyll eat it or leave it on the plate  this is how indian aunties torture you lol  my impression is that they just dont enjoy western food  which is completely fine quite likely what snacks does their daughter come with? if its a western snack  then you can certainly bring it up with her parents in india  its considered quite rude to go to somebodys house and not eat at least a little of what they are offering youhaving said that  you dont want to be pushy the main thing is both your kids are building the friendship so just go with the flowthe real issue is that they dont like western food so even if you cook something special and bring it to them  they may be forced to accept it out of politeness but it would likely go to waste theyll be more than happy to feed your child when she is over there so dont overthink it they are probably happy their daughter has found somebody closeby she can be friends with so  just relax and enjoy the friendship i dont think that they dont enjoy western foodi think this is partially a cultural thing  part of being a good guest is to make sure your host isnt going to be troubled indians have this in common with iranian people  it is considered polite to refuse the first couple of times  unless the host insists if their daughter not eating the snacks you offer is troubling you  politely insist  they might usually take it after a couple of tries  or leave it out and let them help themselves eating sparingly is also considered good manners  rather than eating till fit to burst exchanging food and snacks is a common way of showing friendship so taking food over to their house would be a nice gesture i dont think you need to send your daughter with her own snack i honestly dont know about why the neighbors daughter is bringing her own snacks and is not eating what you all offer it is probably the things that others have said  that she prefers indian snacksregarding the neighbors eating sparingly when theyre over at your place for dinner i have an alternate theory which might be true often indians eat dinner very late at night  maybe even after 10 pm if that is the case with your neighbors then if you offered them dinner at 7 pm they might just not be that hungry  and hence eating sparingly youre overthinking this way too much cheeseburger next time plz its a part of our culture  at least bengali culture  to bring food when we visit any neighbour or relatives ive seen it from a very young age and im used to with it i think you are over thinking it they wont mind  i also have family in us  houston  texas  and they have told me that american food sucks so maybe thats why she doesnt like that its alright   that moment of realisation that american food sucks really bad,2019-04-19 04:13:12

and if you have kids  they will insist on raising them this that way and may continue to haggle her over it they will emotionally blackmail  indian parents are unfortunately masters at this  until they get their way  point is  if she has problems drawing clear boundaries now  it will make your life hellish in the future  no matter how strong a husband you think you are  a marriage is ultimately a two person deal and saving her will only lead to heartbreak and psychologically scarred children  sorry to put it bluntly like that but i feel its the truththe responsible thing  i think  is to really have her come clean on how strongly she wants to work things out with you  versus obey her parents  have an honest sitdown with her and push her into really answering objectively if she is wishywashy  tell her that you will have to leave her because it shows that she is unwilling to face and meet the real consequences of her actions  i know that relationships are rarely black and white in terms of how you feel for each other  and are often very gray  but real world consequences are black and white  with very real specific physical mental emotional results  that is why you have to get firm with her  she is the one who will have to fight  and if keeping the family statusquo is more important to her  she wont have the strength to do so no matter what happens  dont let your feelings for her propel you to save her and be her champion  its almost sure to end badly for you  her  and everybody  it may be painful to break up  but that pain will be nothing compared to what you will save yourself if you dont  so good luck  and remember let it be up to her theres a reason you hardly ever see indian women with non india guys  you just run smack into it shes just like the majority most  indian women simply dont do foreign guys be it tradition  family  cultureunlike any other culture marriage in india  is an utterly unique  special  watershed event im sure you know this thou are you sure that shes with you because she loves you or is she with you because  in a way  youre exotic for her? well i would suggest that you meet up with her family in some other pretext and get a sense about them in many cases i have seen  indian girls are way too scared to talk to their parents like mature adults and perceive things more severely i would also suggest that you should ask her to identify a person close to her parents whom she can trust that person can put in a good word to make things easieron a lighter note watch dilwale dulhania le jayenge  its a similar situation  to some extent  understandably  she does not want tohurt her familys standingscause her family grief and painbasically get shunned and exiled from her family the ball is in her court she needs to think independently and get this sorted on the other hand   i hope she loves you truly and not just because youre from a european country or for financial independence you need to make this very clear please think twice before you proceed some indian women are too emotional and tend to be escapist her parents would constantly belittle her for going  against them and this might  take a toll on your relationship in the near future im also a  minor victim of this  grandkids have fixed some of the relationships your mileage may vary well i am late here but all the best opi hope your woman has the courage to stand up for you in the end the family wants a genuine guy with a decent income and stable life   i am sorry but thats how they work in india  and if they give you the chance to talk and you can convince them  there are possibilities this would be a harsh test of her character and your patience  but i hope you guys come through please keep us updated  move on and break up with her  help info  where s her family located  ? what is her caste ? if she not willing to stand up to her parents let it goi refuse to let anyone on this planet earth dictate who im going to love or marry,2018-08-11 05:50:06

AskIndia,so i am writing a book  titled ironically letters from your bff in response to nikita singhs letters to my ex,3,9b5g5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9b5g5p/so_i_am_writing_a_book_titled_ironically_letters/,4,hey everyone  i have flaired the post askindia  because i am seeking a conversation about absurdities of relationships and interpersonal friendships in todays world would love to hear from you guys my notes on the original book are given below looking forward to your comments and suggestions and experiences and anything else you feel like talking about based on the summary notes of the book i have provided belowletters to my ex is a book by nikita singh  about a girl who runs away from her own engagement ceremony she was supposed to be engaged and married to her own long time boyfriend but yet  she just freaked out and run away she does not talk to anyone after that  and ten months in  she confesses to the boyfriend that she still loves him and makes him swear that he will do everything to earn her trust everyday henceforthi think it is a slightly less intellectual equivalent of notes from the underground  men are not piano keys  fame the format is the same notes from the underground has notes  letters has letters they are both viciously funny and about characters that are absolutely abominableanyways  i started out writing my own response to the girl from the book and plan to publish it as a book of my own introducing concepts from neuroscience and philosophy and conflict resolution and the likesthe original book is located here https  wwwamazonin lettersmyexnikitasinghebook dp b07938vdls refsr_1_2_twi_kin_2?sbooksieutf8qid1535473766sr12keywordsletters+to+my+exthese are my notes# on the bookthis books is about two people who met in college  were going to be married  but the woman ran away from the middle of the engagement ceremony and then they are again engagedas the author states  something essential connects them this is very easy they are connected by deformed ideas of love and a shared identity that they could not shedshe panics because she does not discuss her problems and her idea of her future melts away right in front of her and thereafter she does arbitrary things  does not communicate to anyone and when she meets her boyfriend and takes a look at him having moved on she falls in love with him again and even he falls in love with her  again  because that desire motivates and then he is self absorbed in his own way about her and the girlfriend has no control over him # january theres a lot of talk about the reactions she gets when she breaks off the marriage dad is confused  mom is angry and both of them are disappointed which brings in the next point she is really  really confused at how she ended up being the disappointing one because she is not the one that disappoints  ever because she always behaved like the perfect daughter and who is the perfect daughter? she does not know  she has an image in mind and she maintains itthen we get to see her first meet what we realize is that she is reads a lot and she did not have time for appearances she is a thinker but she thinks a lot really but does not have an internal discipline of truth maintenance she falls in love with a legend he is a cricketer she has heard of him  and he cannot be controlled  can not be tamed  so she gets insecure around him and does not know how to behave and she tries and dominate him  do you like being ignored?  rolls her eyesand then there is the scene in which she breaks off her engagement she runs away in the middle of it all because stress has been building up and there after  she just starts thinking and feeling sad and keeping her thoughts to herself and being disappointed by life in general she thinks that this is all turning out to be like other unhappy  sad  emotionless  married couples and so the idea just freaks her out and so she does not control and run away even in the middle of it  she wants him to come back to her  and run to save her she is running away  but instead of thinking what she has done to him  she really wants him to come get her back so how how in the world is it possible?# february from a lot of the discussion it is somewhat apparent that she resented the involvement of her family into her life there is some psychological projection involved as well their families are trying to conduct the affairs the way that they know is best but after all this involvement  needhi realizes this is not what she had in her mind which is to say  she had an idyllic vision of marriage in her head and the world just did not figure into that so when that image broke  she did not understand what to do about it the more the image changed  the sadder she got none of this  she talked with anyone else  there is the theme of their careers too abhay joined the family business while needhi did not know what to do with her life both are probably liberal arts students  but this is what attracted them to each other  their differences abhay is a cricketer and then works with family business so both require team work while needhi is a more independent person this is the kind of person who would do something innovative when she grows up the problem with needhi is that she does not grow up even abhay has a few problems to deal with  but since all he has to do is follow the rules it never becomes apparent that he is also immature now  major points are that abhay is self assured and traditional  teamplayer while needhi is open to new experiences  independent and a thoughtful person of a more gentle demeanouryes  there it is she has existential problems in life who am i? why am i here? what am i doing? what is my purpose in life? what will bring me happiness? all good questions to ask  and answer  this is a worthy pursuit here  she is incompetent that is the problem she says she wants a weaker memory and that she wants to be less of a control freak that is  she remembers every little thing without being able to let go  and even control is also an inability to let go she has no concept of where her independence ends and where the world begins she even blames abhay for not loving her enough or stopping to love him  and this is after she breaks the engagement so the problem that led to the freaking out at the engagement is being discussed two months after the engagement and it was someone elses fault in fact  she blames it on him that he did not try to stop her when she was running away even though she wanted him to stop her and this is further proof that he had stopped loving her and she was angry when she was running away that she was not stopping her# marchthis is where abhay emails her and within this email we get to know one thing  she never picks up his calls she does accept that this is cowardice  but this needs to be explored why does she not pick up calls? why does she not respond to texts? why does she respond to him now? this is probably because he was confrontational and formal and he asked her point blank why did she do what she did? and then she responds to him maybe partially because she loves him and that she never saw him this way but she responds to him that there was a loss of feeling and that she was a coward not to return calls or texts and that is there so once the self absorbed image breaks down she starts to feel a distance this would be repaired only through creative engagement with stressshe has wrecked her brains but has no answer to his questions why did she do it however  abhay talks about something that hints at her avoidance she avoids calls she avoids confrontation she avoids meeting with abhay when he is with some other girl and then she avoids getting into engagement needhi avoids everything needhi has a void inside her after all this avoidingneedhi has no answers regarding anything  but abhay has a very concrete event that precipitated a change in the feelings when anamika kissed abhay and he did not stop again  this hints at his lack of self regulation there are two components the meaning of the event and the pleasure of the event both are controlled by different subsytems in the brain and this meant that he would not stop the kiss and go with the flow this created dissonance in her head and wrecked everything apart they decide to meet  why is that so? this is probably because they had a heart to heart and treated each other with their intimate thoughts so something built up # aprilthe first thing that jumps out at us is how he just avoids all kind of conversation about the topics that matter she just does not talk about things that matter to her  to the point that abhay has to say that he will not accept that i dont know answer so all this stupidity for three months? just so that she could avoid facing uncomfortable situations in the end she faced an uncomfortable situation because something in her was awakened by a conversation with abhay they talked they talked about what was bothering them and so a little bit of love happenedshe talks about things that make her uncomfortable and gets very emotional  but absolutely refuses to discuss things  because she says there is no point what she does not realize is that there has to be a point  of answering the question  where do we go from here? so she keeps ruminating  discussing and talking the same things again and again but she does not know what to do with the discussion she does not have basic conflict resolution skills all of this is just her feelings  but she herself does not know what to do with the feelings after having two discussions  one in march and the other in april  about things that she did  she feels a little better this is because things have moved further and abhay has discussed and imposed his constraints needhi did not accept even to herself that anamikas kiss had affected her which is why this was buried deep down in her psyche and the memories came back later when it was discussed this is one of those things  she feels that if she does not talk about things then they will go away# maymay is her tinder month here she meets three people the first one is someone who genuinely cares for her  sees her confused and intimidated and guides her through the process the only mistake he makes is that he does not ask her  but just goes on telling her about what he genuinely thinks is helpful she feels he is imposing himself on her and so she does not like it then she is surprised that he enjoyed himself and had a good time with her she ghosts himthen there is the mnc guy who is really high up she is really fascinated by all the work that he does and she really enjoys all the discussion now this could have been her ticket up  but even here she makes the mistake that she is doing nothing she just talks about things  not about herself this is ofcourse  the same mistake that every one makes  which is the presentation of an image to another person who is presenting an image while you have all these thoughts all she had to say is  oh god this is so exciting and then all hell would have broken losethen there is dhruv perfect guy again does everything even stops calling her when she tells him not to he is perfect in every way but she does not feel the spark and how is one supposed to feel the spark talk dhruv  you are such a wonderful person oh my god this is so amazing haha and then he says something and she talks about her own marriage and he comforts her and they lean in and thats that # junethey have a chat in june where they start discussing some things and behave as if things are normal  or near normal abhay is chatting with her simply because there is a wedding coming up and he will be there with a girlfriend needhi takes the opportunity to give him a chance to have a conversation with her about her life now  the two of them have an understanding here that if one talks about her problems  she will simply not have to worry about coming across as weak in fact that is a signal to come closer she calls it breaking the ice she could do the same with other people  but she does notshe is talking about her coworkers  but she is fairly self obsessed she has no ability to talk to other people and presents her interpretation of events rather than talk about actual factsthere is all this talk about awkwardness  which basically makes me think  what the hell? where is the maturity? talk about the elephant in the room#july the one thing that stands out in all of this is needhis need not to have awkwardness awkwardness is assuming some convention  adhering to it  needing to maintain that and pretending nothing happens outside of that script for all of needhis talk of her famillies adhering to some script  even this one is adherence to a script just the one that she chooses she feels awkwardness  she has to be non chalant yet friendly and still not have to overcompensate she just can not feel easy  until alcohol comes and solves the problem bekhuudi a disinhibited state jaam ki zaroorat  hai jaise  bekhoodi ke liyey  bas ek sanam chahiyey  aashiqui ke liyeyneedhis friend confronts her about this and they have a conversation on whether they have really moved on or not and then  she pushes and pulls slowly she says they have moved on  then maybe they are pretending to have moved on there is this issue  of imposing an image and pretending that things are a certain way when they themselves dont know how things already arethen finally it happens they both see each other in their prime abhay is non challant about everything  because  of course  he has a girlfriend needhi becomes vulnerable  partly because she is already in a weakned state because her identity has been broken while abhay is already there so she is hungry and in awe of abhay and there he is non challant as she says and so she is weak and beautiful abhay takes a look at her and his primal love is reactivated and she thinks this is love  which partially it is# augustshe has a mix of depression  anxiety and fever by now she thinks she was moving on  but then again  she does not move on the body is different from her self image  she says she wants to do something  but the body just does not respond of course it wont this is textbook creative stress change will not happen in such a manner and that is the point  she has to confront everything and had abhay never really gotten back to her  she would have had to move on and deal with everything  but no  that is not how it happensabhay talks about being distant from his girlfriend what is going on is that his mind has been occupied by needhi simran is automatically put in the backseat he keeps on blabbering about how he gave all of him to her but that was not enough  and that introduces us to a new concept what do you mean giving it his all? so  that is one thingshe felt better when she had run away  temporarily but now she is devastated there she had to confront the fact that life would not be like she imagined it to be so she freaked out now she has to confront the fact that she still loves abhay and she does not have him in her life and so she freaks out again and this time it is major  because she has to do something but then  she gets it all without doing anything she is basically a slave to her feelings later on we find out that what she just blurts out everything to him that is all that she does# septembershe is reminiscing about their times together needhi freaks out always because she has no endgame in mind and when abhay scolds her or tutors her or lectures her she gets defensive but the point is that she is reminiscing all the good memories are coming backshe admits that they never had any such problems at the time why? because they had nothing to do  really all they had to do was be in love and enjoy the feeling and keep performing the same identitythe one thing that i keep missing out on here is that she is doing really badly in her career too she does not have her shit together this is form an existential standpoint and also the fact that she has no identity to work from this is precisely what ego does  it does not settle  it does not sacrifice it does not know what to do# octobershe finally gives in first there is the rumination she finds a hundred reasons for them not to be together and then she finds a hundred reasons for them to be togethertrust comes up over and over again they have trust issues  yes  of course they will have because they are both unable to deal with anything  they have no binding reality and they act on their whims even though she has been making abhay dance all over her tune  she blames him for kissing anamika and precipitating this she takes no note of the fact that she did not want to deal with it and suppressed the memory# novemberabhay is clearly still in love with her  but he is also torn apart he is completely broken she just left without an explanation  on a whim without doing anything really to be responsible towards abhay so he wants her but he tells her that he cannot trust her and she has to have made a good decision that she is fully in they do not know what a decision isabhay is made to feel guilty and he is already being manipulated by her unknowingly because he is making the promise that he is going to wake up every day trying to gain her trust so now we know that they do not have any idea on how trust emerges either the more important part is that needhi has a very bad effect on abhay and the children do not discuss this with their parents or other responsible adultstheir idea of moving past trauma is to forget it  which is really bad cheating and abandoning well what the fuck really also  i promise to be yours if you promise to be mine mine and yours also what the fuck conditional love its not conditional  its a contract# decembershe feels 19 againthey have a set of promises one is about playing devils advocatethey are marrying  but then since they have not had any commitments here  no concept and no growth what is going on is that they will break up again  brutally and that is why this is a viciously funny book if you know what the fuck is going on she breaks up with him and then tells him to marry him again and now they are going to marry each other without changing anything so what happened  really?

AskIndia, policy  creating jobs in the indian economy,160,66u52j,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/66u52j/policy_creating_jobs_in_the_indian_economy/,82,an askindia thread asked the same question i replied without reading this persons entire post  which turned out to be trolling so im reposting my comment here it starts with some historical background  and ends with a comparative description of how other countries have performedmy answer clothes and shoes1 industrialization historically  models of industrialisation have followed two pathways  slow but steady where western advanced economies like the usa  uk undertook economic development in tandem with political development they did not begin with universal franchise this helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak  accelerated growth economic successes mostly in east asia began authoritarian  explicitly  korea  china  or de facto  singapore  thailand  taiwan   and gave way to political transformation only after a degree of economic success was achieved2 where does india stand india has attempted economic development while also granting universal franchise from the very beginning the only other countries in this group are botswana  mauritius  jamaica  trinidad and tobago  and costa rica  all perennial democracies at independence  india was one of the poorest nations  regardless of political system  with a per capita gdp of just 617  ppp  this implies  the indian state has been ever burdened by the demands for redistribution since early in its life  leading to the poor state capacity we see today  healthcare  education  law enforcement   there is a distrust of the private sector and overreliance on public capacity  exit  that is  winding down  declaring bankruptcy  and plugging inefficiencies is hard because of diverse stakeholders  vested interests  and poor institutions3 what kind of jobs does india need  india needs to generate jobs that are formal and productive  provide bangforbuck in terms of jobs created relative to investment  have the potential for broader social transformation  and can generate exports and growth apparel and footwear sectors fit this bill4 how have apparel and footwear worked for the east asian economies? in the successful east asian economies  countries where gdp growth booms averaged between 710 per cent  growth in the exports of these two sectors was exceptional for comparison  over a 20 year period postliberalisation for each economy  country year of takeoff annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off  per cent  of apparel annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off  per cent  of leather and footwear annual avg economic growth for 20 years post take off  per cent       korea 1962 304 699 90 bgl 1985 279 298 52 thailand 1960 538 441 75 indonesia 1967 658 486 70 malaysia 1970 334 275 69 china 1978 186 277 98 vietnam 1985 178 161 66 india 1980 127 54 56 5 why has india underperformed? for a lot of historical  religious  and sociocultural reasons however  those pertinent to contemporary times include  logistics costs and time for getting goods from factorytoport are greater furthermore  indian ports are unequipped to handle very large capacity containers we use sri lankan ports for such transshipments  labor regulations labor costs are low  but regulations strangulate formalization because of high overtime pay requirements  de facto epf contribution taxes for lowpaid workers  and inflexible firing policies  tax and tariff policies indias domestic tax policies and unbalanced in that they promote cottonbased fibres instead of manmade fibres  which is the bulk of the global demand similarly  the global demand is for nonleather footwear  while indias share of global exports in leather footwear are double that of nonleather footwear  ie it wrongly focuses on leather footwear   export market discrimination eu and us impose customs tariffs on indian apparel and footwear exports at 10  while it is 0 for bangladesh so indian firms shift operations outside of indiawhat should india do?   what is it doing? ill add in this later if i see this post getting enough traction writing all of this took a lot of time in and of itself if you have any suggestions  write away in the comments,ringtring, theres a great

crucial sector we might be overlooking though  public sector jobs  especially police  judiciary and healthcare workers this is important  firstly  because most of our public services are so understaffed there is massive log jamming in the judiciary for instance  scant police coverage in most areas  absolute lack of healthcare facilities in a large part of the country an efficient economy can only be built in the foundation of a well functioning polity a healthier  safer society is an absolute necessity for a healthy economy secondly  having more public sector jobs ends up creating more private jobs  especially in the service economy the problem we run into when speaking of public sector is jobs is financing this is a big problem i believe fully staffing our public services is an investment we dont question the need for physical infrastructure  we shouldnt for well staffed public services also  its high time we did something about the shameful legacy of the past  housing our netas in palatial bungalows  the most expensive real estate in the country sell of lutyens delhi babu bungalows  create a fund  invest in human capital  this should be a sticky post economic survey this year had a separate chapter on clothes and shoes  you should read that eu resident here most of the top quality branded clothes  hoodies  tshirts and jeans  we wear here and houseries  including ikea  are actually made in bangladeshif anyone can supply these products with same quality and similar price  i can create a few jobs in india good start admins should close the other troll genocide thread ill try to divide my reply in two parts the first where i reply to some of your points and the second where ill try to write up some new parts which you didnt touch on__________________________________________________________first part slow but steady western economies accelerated growth east asiathis is actually somewhat inaccurate as dani rodrik and many others have pointed out  there has only been one single path to prosperity for large economies which cant rely on fossil fuels or on tourism like trinidad and tobago  thats the path of exportled manufacturing growth most people mistakenly think this is the east asian model but this was how the uk  germany and france all developed same is true with the us manufacturing was a huge part of the us economy up until perhaps the 1970s some people claim india cant replicate this model for two reasons the first is automation ai  which limits employment opportunity the second is slow trade protectionism ill be brief on bothas far as ai automation is concerned  a lot of people have to understand that plenty of jobs that were counted as manufacturing in the past were actually service sector jobs its just that they were in the factory back in the old days today everything is hyperspecialised  so a lot of those jobs have moved out but are socalled auxiliary services they dont get counted with manufacturing today  but they should if they were  job losses arent nearly as bad as its made out to beas for trade protectionism is concerned  its true that the world economy is growing slower than during the boom times  but historical perspective is needed the average growth during the 1990s was slower than what the world economy is growing at right now korea  taiwan and the other asian tigers as well as ireland and some eastern european nations poland  slovakia etc  had very rapid growth during this period  despite generally low global growth so  i think this excuse doesnt really hold today yes  the opportunities are lower than in the 2000s  but from a historical perspective they are slightly above average  sadly our focus has been on cotton and yarn exports at best fabrics and some niches like home textiles we havent been able to crack the apparels segmentour largest textile companies  measured in terms of investment or market cap  are yarn companies or home fabrics companies in footwear we could have an edge in leather footwear  but this beef ban thing could be a detterant   u ringtring your original post is good but i would like to point that thailand  bgl bangladesh?   malaysia and indonesia are not under east asia but under asean few points   where western advanced economies like the usa  uk undertook economic development in tandem with political development they did not begin with universal franchise semantic use of the term in tandem is not accurate enough plus the timelines are so broad they are meaningless  using such broad terms one can even say that south korea developed under this slow western model because it changed its system before it had become developed  the fact is the political development is a spectrum in itself and the west like us esp was on the end of this spectrum closer to everyone else who developed than on the other end of it  where basically no one exists  meaning  no one has ever developed under a democracy and since democracies are of various types we need to provide context for it and that context was provided things like universal suffrage is a basic and easy metric india is an older proper democracy than us in this manner   other can be used as well like the power holdings among a few rich homogeneous elites even despite the voting rights  as for the point on why india has underperformed  the fundamental reasons are that india has not followed the general path that leads to development there is no universal model for it but there are certain practices which are nearuniversal meaning they are de facto prerequisite requirements  things like having an infrastructure in place before you set up a secondary and tertiary sector like services and rd  this a a dynamic which goes even beyond industrialization there is no development and stability without infra development roads were the first things a new empire build  then at the same time as this is land reforms  its another prerequisite there are plenty of evidence for this with countries that developed in the 20th century  everything else comes afterwards india is accumulating factors which are exceptional  things like democracy from the get go  tertiary sector before infrastructure land reform not even done barring few places like kerala  its no wonder things wouldnt be smooth sailing and about what india needs  i am of a different view india should help where the people are and they are in the primary sector  they are farmers that is where the labor force is help them and you solve multiple problems problems like lack of jobs if everyone over the coming generations is supposed to enter the job pool problems like not enough capital for other major works which will become obsolete  exclusive factories are not a sound long term gambit  problems like uprooting people in a country like india which is unique in terms of its diversity and already having massive population density issues  helping the people in the agriculture sector is the biggest bang for the buck it helps bring the hdi levels up  it helps the social security dynamic it helps in the balanced development of all majority people argument   currently though there is no proper model for it and this is where my views are different than most india is already doing things in its own way it is already the exception it should look for new models of growth instead of relying on preexiting ones which may or may not really be that effective at the stage india is in no model is universal  they have to be fitted to the place they are being implemented in india should look for solutions which are novel and unique to its situation   currently though india seems to have picked the same model of growth that has been used by majority of the world and that is rapid growth through fast tracked urbanization 10 years back indian urbanization rate was less than 20  now its reaching mid 30s  to me this goes against the india ethos and even practically its not sound for india given its unique spread of population over a smaller area and stressed natural resources   when koreans chinese started to make toys to be sold in the west  they never knew they would become some one like this indian ways of growing is not faulty  it can be considered as a new way we have a lot problems which most previous governments ignored and china korea us gave a lot of importance during early industrializationindustrialization needs infrastructure  skilled worker and rule of law which are missing in india we have a pathetic infrastructure because the government doesnt want to anger people and politicians have a huge interest in infrastructure building  we could not build everything very quickly roads bridges ports railways are very slow and inefficient most people will not leave land easily the environment must be protected the contractors also make a lot of money by building everything slowly and of bad quality rural education is in a very bad condition most factory workers  construction crew usually come from rural areas in india  most of them are very unskilled and difficult to be trained inefficient governance is also another reason our state is very backward it takes days for people to get the documents and months for companies bureaucrats usually dont work for people unless someone attacks them law enforcement is also very bad  this post and the discussion that it brought fold is gold ive been through the entire thread and this is some real quality discussion thanks to everyone who contributed to the discussion  reading it has been a pleasure its disheartening that the comments dont have as many points and the ones in the political threads do  one area prime for reforms and job creation i feel is agriculture i think india is employing a huge proportion of its population in farming and yet its very inefficient  maybe the latter is the cause for former i think agriculture can be leveraged to bring jobs to rural areas bu investing in rural infrastructure creation  warehouses and storage  distribution and transportation and food processing this coupled with building human resource capital in rural and semiurban areas be it teachers public transportation workers  support personnels etc manufacturing should be our main focus and we should focus on both domestic oriented and export oriented manufacturing    where western advanced economies like the usa  uk undertook economic development in tandem with political development they did not begin with universal franchise this helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weakas far as uk is concerned  what period was the capacity weak  when did it become strong? i dont think india has an  unemployment problem it just has people who dont want to work  ,2017-04-22 17:49:09

i mean  a picture is supposed to be worth a thousand words my two bits remove the political post politics altogether from this sub our life is teeming with enough politics already be it newspaper or news channel with blaring mindless debates airing all day and since many redditors have complained about the same in many self posts it seems like the right time to do soyou can direct those who wants to discuss that to something like  r indiapolitics if it exists or make one for them like many other countries sub did   if still you see people have this great uncontrolled urge to discuss which politician wrote what on twitter and those other shit you can always give them a warning first and if they dont comply then ban them from this sub not shadowban let them know why they are banned   id suggest some flairs like arts  sports and religion more flairs will keep different posts from getting mixed and people interested in a particular thing probably wont downvote the stuff they are not interested in and new genuine posts in their respective category will hopefully get a breathe of upvote from interested people +1 for no political twitter spam  remove loweffort political selfpostsplease elaborate on this?also  you guys to need to ensure greater transparency in your process no direct submission to images  including memes  and twitter if you want to submit an image or a twitter post  create a selfpost and explain what is it that you want to discuss about iti dont think this serves any purpose at all the reason these memes and tweet links exist is not for ops to score cool karma points  but to reinforce his her own political views so self post or not  these low effort posts would continue to clutter the feed remove loweffort political selfpostsyou will need to elaborate on this or else you are going to get accused of muzzling opinions  since there is an announcement  i want to bring up couple of points which affects the quality of discussion here  these are tangentially related             does this sub have an official stand or voice on any issue? is it a place for discussion only or reddit india supported activism?  for example net neutrality debate i think the official voice of redditindia should not get into activism irl it encourages brigading and suppressing contrary voices          i think it was wrong that redditindia took an official position on contentious issue like nn which lead to brigading in real life  shouldnt have happened            second  do we need the twitter account of redditindia to tweet hot posts? and is there a criteria i  have seen low effort self posts getting tweeted i  see that as an encouragement  ooh common account as a mod interestinggovernance flair sounds good hopefully well have more discussions on that how about a flair to seperate the faking news unreal times articles from the real news  political discussions should be strictly  r  enforced remove loweffort political selfpostsyes and yes but we have fallen short because we dont have enough active moderators we would need to hire more the problem is we need to find people who have the time and inclination to do thisany other conditions? wheeee flairs   til  lpt jugaad  eli 5  itap  tomt  throwback for old awesome posts that newcomers can enjoy like out of loop     but can we also have something against down voting self posts into oblivion?       removed  you people tried to moderate political thread last time as well it didnt work politics is the major subject on this sub and unless you double the moderators keeping political posts strictly r enforced will be hard   removed  having to explain memes kind of spoil the fun and that also kind of deters the content makes  who am i kidding  no randian makes original content  even then  atleast its possible in the future aand thats how you make a dead subbtw instead of these useless flairs why not make a delhi flair to filter it out all the useless aap posts i have a moderation related questions   when moderators delete a post  i have seen 3 kinds of things happening1 a comment is posted to the thread about why it was deleted   2 a  deleted  message appear on the self post    3 sometimes neither of the 2 happen  but the post still disappears    so whats the difference? why not a message in the thread any time a post is deleted by moderation?    add a flair for geopolitics  askindia is good but i dont think governance flair would be used often rather  have a weekly flair for regular posts another suggestion  have a bjp aap congress flair along with political a lot of people want to read political news not related to these 3 parties ,2015-07-16 05:41:23
AskIndia,well articulated anti congress whatsapp forward bhakton ki nayi  p eshkash,2,7zckca,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7zckca/well_articulated_anti_congress_whatsapp_forward/,5,received on the family whatsapp groupa brilliant answer by bala senthil kumar to the question below  as answered at popular qa site quora what is your view on the saying congress has looted india for 70 years?it isnt the looting of wealth that bothers me so much as the sheer fact that the congress merely replaced the brits in some ways  they just became masters of the same  broken  weak people  who were simply willing to suck up to authority nobody gave india confidence this is the part that bothers me so much  especially with mk gandhis style of winning us freedom by giving the enemy higher moral groundso  india has grown up as an apologetic impotent nation  where our children are taught to revere impractical  passive  cowardly notions like nonviolence  when everything in nature tells us to fight to survive of course i know the philosophy of not fighting because of being strong but this comes from mastery  not shamelessly bowing to mastersso  we saw a change of guard the brits went  and new masters came in the form of the congress party hierarchies remained  the class system remained  and subservience remained where the heck did all the dynamism go?then we were thrown into a socialist mindset  people waiting for alms from government wealth redistribution programs instead of being empowered we got protectionist policies  that prevented prosperity and competition  throwing us away from a path of a meritocracy hindustan motors was started around the same time as toyota  and tata steel started around the same time as nippon steel nippon steel produces around five times as much as tata steel without native resources of ore no need to talk about hindustan motors and toyota japan coming out of twin nuclear strikes was devastated way more than india under the brits do we need to compare how different the growth paths of these two nations have been?only when thousands died did we start the green revolution only when china attacked us did we realize we need to become militarily stronger only with our backs against the wall  did india liberalize its economy under the congress  every move we have made towards any kind of development has come under inevitable circumstances  with our backs against the wallindia was never allowed to be truly independent  strong  and proud of its peoples full potential no wonder so many of us left in droves and thrived in various countries elsewhere this is the loot i would feel most wronged by  denying india its best talents and minds  because we didnt create the conditions for dignified developmentincredibly  the immense sacrifices of our fighting heroes were also swept aside under this avalanche of worship for gandhiji why? so that the brits would feel good? the congress party was reporting to british intelligence for 5 years after we became an independent country  about subhash boses familys movements during a criminal probe of the bofors scandal  the congress external affairs minister delivered a letter to a foreign body to deny evidence and cooperation to an indian investigating agency years later  a whole bunch of congress members and their cronies used the letterhead of the indian parliament to petition the usa to not issue a visa to narendra modi  the man who would become prime minister the congress has a clear obsession with white people and a need to constantly please them when hillary clinton asked india to wean itself off iranian oil  the congress government promptly obliged  even though iran and india have been close friends for a long time no surprise then that pasta aunty from italy is their supremo think she would have got the same respect if she had been a nigerian black woman? i dont think so thats how deeply ingrained the slave mentality is in the ranks of the congressit is the loot of indias pride  dignity  dynamism and die hard spirit that bothers me much much more than the loot of wealth this country produced enough wealth to support the british empire for 200 years it can easily produce much more to ensure prosperity  health and well being for its own people this is an abundant  powerful country  that has been prevented from being a developed  forward thinking  awesome nation that could by now have been an example for the worldif india has been a weak  apologetic nation for so long  its precisely because of the congress why do we have to put up with these weasels and the fools who are aligning with them? i could even tolerate a ruthless  despotic  dictatorial mindset it is this slimy  backstabbing  self serving lutyens mindset that really irks me i would give anything to destroy this smugness  decimate it  and put it firmly behind usthe economic loot is nothing compared to this  but we will bloody well make them pay for all of iti received this message i want you to read and think about it i am forwarding for that purpose,Bikihuigormint, bjp has learnt a lot from the humble onion  narratives on narratives and the core  nothing  nobody gave india confidence playing with peoples insecurities not getting any women use this axe deodorant and women will flock to youdid congress do nothing to give confidence to indian people? when congress came to power it denotified the tribes which had so far been classified as criminal tribes by recognizing their humanity  and by giving them an equal opportunity did it not give them confidence what about the right to vote given to women and outcasts? was it not ahistoric in the region and the states which were created on linguistic basis  mk gandhis style of winning us freedom by giving the enemy higher moral groundit was exactly opposite gandhism is a method to uphold the humanity and moral standards of the victims  hierarchies remained  the class system remained  and subservience remained when congress came to power  one of the first thing it did was to abolish zamindari system then it gave voice and entitlements to outcasts  where the heck did all the dynamism go?dynamism of british period? are sanghis missing their golden age under white masters? people waiting for alms from government wealth redistribution programs instead of being empoweredpeople were not waiting for alms people were poor and starving some folks have forgotten how poor india was and still it should congress have allowed them to die like china did? is taking care of starving people and empowering them mutually exclusive? can you not do both at the same time? was it not something congress did? india was never allowed to be truly independent  strong  and proud of its peoples full potential no wonder so many of us left in droves and thrived in various countries elsewhere nris guilt   ffs all these chutiyas complaining about indias weakness and impotence are so clearly projecting their own shortcomingsindia managed to stay nonaligned under severe pressure from both us and ussr under nehru we were able to stave off handing over economy to the world bank and imf for as long as we could and when he opened up  we did it on our terms we engaged in 4 wars and came out on top in at least 3we lifted more people out of poverty than any other country except china and corrected social injustices like untouchability which had existed for centuriesand all of this while being a functional democracy  empowering civic institutions and fostering an inclusive multilingual  multicultural societyhow on earth  can someone say that is weak? if your family thinks this is any sort of accurate or well articulated i fear for their intelligence just a hypocritical nri bhakt ranting about things he is  too lazy and selfish to change himself  so many similarities between our new dumb entitled middle class and the hypocritical nationalist nris,2018-02-22 19:13:35
AskIndia,buying an apartment in hyderabad,6,8dg2ih,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8dg2ih/buying_an_apartment_in_hyderabad/,4,hi everyone i am planning to buy an apartment in hafeezpet the total amount is 47 lakhs for 1100 sqft near main road is this normal price? i am not so keen on buying but my parents in india are adamant about it rent expected is around 15000 + 1500 maintenance planning to take a loan for 30 lakhs and use cash 20 lakhsedit i dont know why i am getting downvoted   i just asked a question with the askindia flair,mdocvar, when you said parents in india i am assuming you are abroad actually my parents also forced me to buy a house which was around 75 lakhs chennai   but i didnt  i dont know about your age  income  risk appetite etc  here is what i would do1  if i have 20 lakhs cash  bare minimum i would deposit in fd which would earn interest of 12 500 month this is based on rbl bank interest rate2  i would then use 50 of this 12 500 every month to invest in stocks and 25 into mutual funds and keep the remaining as cash for rainy day3  if i have more risk appetite i would divide this 20 lakhs into multiple staggered buy for stock which i am currently studying 4  rental income in india is not profitable plus you will pay emi for probably 20 years which is again a burden on you5  there are beautiful emi calculators online which will tell you how much you will end up paying for the 27 lakhs for 20 years which is around 58 lakhsis it worth it?? mehthis is just my thought bro if you want to buy it because you and your parents need a place of your own to live and given that you can pay it off with the time you have left on your visa then it makes more sense as much as i understand and appreciate  people living off a rented space because for them economically it makes sense i would still suggest you to buy your own place it will give you peace of mind and moving every two  three year is not that fun on the top of everything intrusive flat owners   but if your sole aim is to save some money or create a new asset like this place as a future investment then i might suggested you should look for other investment opportunities  in that case atleast you will have a rough idea how much return you can expect off your money down the line  you can also check out r indiainvestments ask the same thing there maybe those guys could be of more help,2018-04-20 06:12:13

do you mean a comment?2 do you mean nonpersonal verified instead of nonpersonal and verified? direct submission to nonpersonal and unverified twitter accounts for political and policy posts is also not allowedisnt submission of unverified account anyway not allowed?and so the only twitter accounts that are allowed for direct link submission are nonpersonal verified accounts like  pmoindia  right? similarly  if you wish to cite an unverified twitter account for a political policy religious post  you need to do so in a selfpost  after hiding personal information from said tweet  and substantiate what you wish to discuss in the threadin such a submission can the name of the twitter handle be mentioned in the title? have seen a few such posts in the recent past all of this is going to lead to  more controversies  ok  i almost never checkin here except when i do the odd rdd thread but i cannot believe this kind of policing is still happeningwhat kind of a place has this turned into that its making normal everyday indians who are more worried about the kujhli in their underpants to be this aggressive brand of assholes? here we go again more and more poorly thought out rules  imposed on the subreddit without any discussion indians are political and argumentative people you mods cannot wish that away with your silly rules just let the sub be instead of trying to sanitize the discussions this is a chai stall at a railway station  not a formal dinner in victorian england  why is so much importance being given to political religious threads? why isnt the no loweffort rule being applied to all the threads and posts? man  either apply the rules uniformly or dont apply them at all and let us decide if something is high or low effort i have seen the no loweffort rule in other subs too but they apply it to everything more subjective rules with loopholes as a prerequisite and a necessary design criteria now  there is no way to differentiate between these two 1 this means most jokes  memes  noncontributive comments will be removed2 political humour posts are exempt from these rulesso  basically  when our subjective call says that the user is flaming the forum  we can instaban the user but  we can use yet another subjective call to claim that a different user was just indulging in political humor just let this forum be why the fuck do we have religious threads this is how you make a dead sub ive seen  r indias rules worst so far the twitter rules are fucking irritating  this means most jokes  memes  noncontributive comments will be removedwtf why cant you guys just let the sub be as it is without adding new rules etc for even one month?would be renamed to policy it applies to any new policy decision announced by the governmenti dont understand the need for a separate flair for this such discussions should be under politics  removed  less objectivity  more subjectivity i can already see numerous ways in which these rules can be twisted and interpreted to suit a persons personal biasesloweffort comments that dont contribute to the discussion will be removedwhat criteria will be used to decide whether a comment is loweffort or not? mods subjective views?asking where are the people of x party or y group now adds nothing constructive to the discussion and will be removedokay  so if supporters of a particular party bash another party based on a false report as has happened so many times   and later on the truth gets posted  can we not ask where the bashers are now? whats wrong with that? nice also please try and do a full revision of the rules like all the rules at one place hallelujah thanks for this are these rules going live along with post  or are you looking for building up opinion and then implememting it?  agreed with the policy for political threads  but not religious threads as rational people we should be allowed to ridicule religions not adherents  but the religion itself if i wish to call mohammad a paedophile  yahweh a genocidal maniac or indra a pussyman  there shouldnt be a ban on it  could you sticky this  please?

if you stay locally then you both have to visit relatives weddings etc that can cause frictions and can upset your wife if your relatives say something ridiculous stand up for yourself this is your life dont let some 500 year old tradition drive your life good luck edit stay out of sight  go back to foreign country again?   will it really affect my sisters wedding?if arranged marriage  it will effect in the sense there would be some assholes who wouldnt want to get married into your family but do note that your sister is better off not getting married to an asshole of a family what is standing in the society  or prestige do these things actually take a beating?this is a tough question i can give only my view based on anecdotal evidence  do note that i live in urban area is south indiait frankly depends on extended family in the inter caste marriages i have seen  one girls parents were boycotted by extended family for around 23 years petty snarky remarks in family functions  not attending wedding  avoid meeting etc her husbands family  except his mother  came around and rallied around the couple in another couple i know  the guys parents are still pissed off  5 years now  but it was more because of love marriage rather than arranged his parents extended aunty club cribs on not following certain customs  like wearing mangalsutra   skin color etcso if your mom dad care a lot for what the extended family thinks of them and or the extended family is their primary social circle  and the social circle is casteist  their prestige can take a beating however  you are an adult and you have to live your decision i cant answer this question but you may want to put in a serious or reddiquette tag if you are serious about nontrolling answers  if someone is rejecting your sister because you married outside your caste then she shouldnt be marrying the guy anywayjust my 02 rupee here is what i think   i think you are making a mistake leave her nowhere is why?if you wanted to be with that girl   absolutely none of the objections you have raised would matter no one and i mean no one has a right on your future life you and your partner have to be the only ones to decide so even by asking the question and in the tone you have asked  i posit that you are not really into herdrop it now  not for the reasons you suggest but because you are not into her honor killing is a possibility theyll hack you and your wife into pieces and feed them to the goats gaus but seriously fuck the orthodoxy if you want indian society to progress you need to break away from useless traditions and mindsets which your family unfortunately still apparently follows screw your parents  not literally  your sister will be fine its not like shes gonna be married the next day of your own marriage chillmarryrepent  evaluate the fact if the girl is really the one if the answer is yes  other things dont matter time heals everything and when your parents relatives realize that you made a good choice they will reconsider their position  editing a few spelling mistakes  will it really affect my sisters wedding?yes it will  rajasthan in particular is a bitch about this both my sisters are married out of community and trust me most of the family outright reject meeting my dad because of this  i am not pushing for marriage  my dad has no timepass so he is busy wasting his time on getting an arranged wedding done  but the ones who do get ready fall into two bunch  one who are genuinely nice and progressive people and the second bunch who think this will be way of getting extra dowry from the brides family so thats that if you think you sister can find a or wants to find a partner on her own  then dont worry what is standing in the society  or prestige do these things actually take a beating?asshat from the community will bitch about it for the first few years  after that everyone shuts up once they find out how well the couple is doing if you are confident you will end up in strong marriage with your gf then do go ahead and not let the samaj bother you if you are both outside india  then why dont you marry there nobody will really care in a few years,2016-06-29 23:21:13

bad titling? additionally  please bring your objections to modmail  because we will not allow any negative community meta or drama posts the place to ask for removal clarifications is modmail not the subredditabsolutely no point to this leave it to the users intelligenceadding a question  why is pure theology as  u rahulthewall puts it is banned in this subreddit? isnt this also a sub where history is discussed a verse of the rig veda was banned while an article talking about hindu mythology in mediumcom was allowed clarify your stand if youre supporting banning it in the future  thats stupidthe twitter flair is a nice idea btw score hiding will be awesome good job modsps would never want to become mod too much hardwork you guys are good keep it up can you put multiple flairs on the same post? ie if i post an article which is more than 6 months old about a political subject  what should i flair it as?   what if its a twitter comment which is political and more than 6 months old?    can bringing up a users posting history be classified as a personal attack? yesbadbut anything even borderline  r subredditdramabadfor instance  r polandball 6  does not allow xposts to communities as large as oursbadeverything else sounds great  deleted  points are still visible on mobile or if you disable css  right?  are you guys still taking the feedback? if yes then i suggest to not include askindia flair but instead redirect those to  r askindia like  r europe has on the topalso sometimes exact title rule doesnt really tell what is in the article so for that something like editorialized flair should be thereand now some queries  how much time should we wait for the mods to respond if the modmail is sent? does repost removal policy apply only to that article from one source or other sources too? because different sources have difference in how the story is presented about scoopwhoop storify buzzfeed  looks like these sites have now gotten mainstream with a lot of nonspammy users submitting links from them please use voting to keep clickbaits down and we will ban new spam sitesyou dont have to ban all links from these sites just the ones that have embedded youtube vimeo videos also  could you guys have automod notify us every time a comment that breaks the rule is deleted i use cunt a lot  and it seems to be a word that is monitored closely often ive noticed that my comments carrying the word get deleted even when used in a nonsexist or satirical context i would like to know if when any of my comments are deleted i dont see whats wrong with it  thanks for the flairsedit i still see two flairs only not activated yet?edit 2 ah i see   personal attack rule review  no change the community is a lot better since we undertook all the trouble to cut out the slurs well keep this rule going for now can bringing up a users posting history be classified as a personal attack?

my hometown? husbands hometown?  i need to decide this asap as traveling after 28 weeks april end that is  is generally not advisedwhich brings me to making this post here i want to gather all the information anectodes experiences  in a countdown way  about the dday dweeks if the circumstances allow  i would prefer a normal delivery however  i totally understand how uncertain pregnancies can get i just feel being informed can help us stay less anxious  not panic its going to be long and my thoughts might seem all over the place  so please bear with me here are my questions1  how frequent are the scheduled ob gyn visits in the very last month  assuming a normal pregnancy? currently i visit once a month  for routine check up and milestone mandated tests  flu vaccination  various blood tests  sonography  etc  by scheduled i mean no complication was experienced by the woman or any urgency water breaking  bleeding  etc  occured 2  one lady who had the same obgyn as me when went for her scheduled 37th week visit  was told she will have a csection as the child is getting overweight  weighing 3 kgs then  the obgyn asked her to soon decide which date she would like the surgery to happen and let the doctor know the lady said she however got labor pain the very next day and delivered via vaginal delivery now  i am a little skeptical here  from what ive read  2535 kgs is the average birth weight for newborns in india how can 3 kgs be overweight then? im already very paranoid about the state of deliveries in urban  bigname hospitals and this incident scares me more there is no data public on the number of normal and surgical deliveries a hospital has  so that one can decide  and once youre in  youre in after that  you have to leave everything at the doctor3  one lady who delivered at the same hospital  different obgyn  as me  went at 37 weeks when she felt contractions her cervix was examined twice in a 5 hour span she said she couldnt bear going through that painful examination again and asked for a csection herself  totally fair  my question is  are these cervix examinations by hand so necessary  when theyre leaving the bearing lady in pain? is there no other way  imaging  ultrasound  etc ? my point is those contractions could have been what is called false labor and if not for the pain due to the examination  that lady could have gone home and come again fullterm or when she felt contractions again?4  my sister went for a scheduled visit in 38th week her cervix was examined  she started bleeding she was told to come back if bleeding continued till evening  which it did she had to be operated the next day  after staying in labor room for some 2432 hours this again makes me skeptical about cervix examinations5  whats the countdown going to be like? when does one know that yes  its now that i rush to the hospital should i be scared of just a few drops of blood? should i rush the very first time i experience period like cramps? from my few interactions with mothers  i feel 3738 weeks is the sweet spot where many things happen i know my post gives a lot of distrusting vibes towards doctors  that theyre there to loot us  they try to invent some complication in these sweet spot weeks to push for csections  etc trust me  i would like to be proven wrong hence  im here to collect as much anectodes about false alarms  doctor sending the lady home even after mild contractions as its not time yet instead of asking to schedule a csection  etc as i can5  from what i understand  some women might never experience labor even after 4041 weeks and hence have to be induced are some women induced before that too? what could lead to induction before full term?6  do all women having a vaginal delivery get an epidural other pain medication  or only those who demand it when they get tired  or when they cant bear pain?7  did anyone research natural birth centers? there are many in the major cities  like 1  sanctum birth center  hyderabad  2  birth village  kochi  3  daimaas natural birth center  mumbai  4  apollo cradle  gurugram google reviews are mixed anyone undertook the services of these natural birth centers?so everyone  contribute what you can towards my questions  in general  your pregnancy stories,2throwawaythrowaway, op  post this in r twoxindia as well https  wwwbabycentercom childbirthclass has all you need to know about child birth regarding centers city hospital  i dont know india c section is becoming very much the de facto option which is sad malpractice by doctors most cases natural birth is possible without much medication 3 of my kids were natural born without any medication 4th one  actually our 2nd  she took epidural 1 depends on the risk factors high risk pregnancies require weekly monitoring otherwise bi monthly suffice2 3 is average and is by no means overweight   3 cervical examination is done to check how much the cervix has dilated i was checked every hour when i went in while in labor  about 34 times  ended up with a emergency c section as large baby + baby in distress4 any bleeding in late term  even if its due to cervical examination needs to be monitored unless the doctor did a membrane sweep  there shouldnt really be a bleeding but then again depends on sensitivity i guess5 i had a cervical check a day prior to my labor  i was at week 39 and very close to my due date  and i had no bleeding but went into labor naturally much later at night i woke up with back pain after midnight and i just knew this was it went to the loo  water broke  told my husband it was time and then woke up my parents waddled to hospital 2 hours later after i timed my contractions and knew they were getting a min apart 6 high risk and multiples also indian doctors love inducing women even when they are in labor to reduce the labor time which makes it much harder on the women  i was induced despite being in labor already and the pain shot through the roof 7 only large hospitals can administer pain relief for vaginal birth as most hospitals in india dont have monitoring systems in place to check for contractions and tell the woman to push 8 none i was birthing at my home town so i chose the one which had a sensible doc that would listen to me and not swat my concerns as google led look up water birthing  think theres one in kerala but im of the give birth in hospital opinion as i dont know how equipped these centers are to handle post natal and intensive care for babies all the best best to cross post to the twoxindia sub as well,2020-03-19 04:13:12

AskIndia, askindia  how many months left till india gets slapped with hefty sanctions?,38,ez5344,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ez5344/askindia_how_many_months_left_till_india_gets/,35,less than 10 crores blind bhakts out of 140 crores indians  have done immense damage to image of india in all international stages india has been bullying all forms of protesters when malaysia criticized an indian policy  indian government stopped importing palm oil from malaysia but karma always bites back with interest many usa company heads are also criticizing india  resulting in backlash from government of india it may be a just matter of time  usa gets royally pissed off with india and starts imposing sanction in the lines of iran  iraq  syriayour thoughts please,satyasys, if we get sanctioned then the poor will suffer more  so i hope never not happening some legislators and committees here and there may criticize  but outright sanctions are out of the question us and eu governments are neither that moral nor that concerned as to jeopardize all their business investments and military purchases from india i doubt that will happen because us sees india as a counter to china how delusional can you be? the world isnt a black and white place where justice is always served and righteous people always win everyone has their vested interestsand you seriously think that there are only 10 crore bhakts?sometimes it makes me think that the left wing is filled with idealistic babies with zero knowledge of ground realities i sometimes wonder  is the iq level of reddit crowd plummeting day by day or what? what are you  a 14 year old asking such retarded questions when you yourself can very vividly answer the question yourself  india is a major trading partner to many important countries including the usa  eu and russia  india has far more good relations with other governments of latin america  africa than it has enemies  on what moral grounds will the countries sanction us? caa? on what grounds? when the most powerful country in the world actively blocks citizens from random muslim countries and eu nations have their own problems with immigration  integration  comparing with the countries like iran  iraq  syria you would be dead if you had pulled even the 1 of protest level against the government i mean do you even know what you write? imao china has literal concentration camps for muslims and the world did shit  people need to stop seeing west as some bastion of justice they only sanction someone when they have something to gain sanctions are a foreign concept we dont care bhakts will be happy that now hindus can manufacture whatever they want right here in indiathey will see this as a plus this has been discussed on this sub beforethe govts response to protests against the caa is an internal matter  and much like the us presidents subtle  indirect support of neonazis and white supremacy in america  the outside world doesnt have the authority to interfere what happens is that with the outcomes of studies like the democracy index  freedom of press  ease of doing business etc  the conception of india changes and that impression is quite important when it comes to european countries investing in india  or even japanese korean companies investing in india there is no doubt about the fact that the right wing ideology pursued by the govt is hurting or economy  but it wont invite sanctions a la north korea or iran the only thing that could do so now is if india invaded pok  or something similarly drastic  which the bjp govt wont do before the delhi elections bjp could be the worst govt in recent memory  but criticizing our sanctions on malaysia is plain stupid our foreign service did the right thingin foreign affairs a head of a country usually does not comment on the internal affairs of another country be it right or wrong even the presidents of fucking america and china do not explicitly comment on our internal affairs the way mahatir didthe language used is very important  usually presidents use statements like  we hope for a deescalation etc  and they do not mention the ruling govt of another country in their statementif mahatir had genuine concerns he would have no issues criticizing china for their uighur treatmentif we didnt sanction malaysia for that statement we would be treated as pushovers on the world stage there is no right or wrong in foreign affairs  india being a big regional power has to act like one  usa gets royally pissed off with india and starts imposing sanction in the lines of iran  iraq  syriaus can no longer apply sanctions to india the way they did back in 1998 the us depends a lot on india for cheap labor and an upcoming internetrelated customer baseeven if modi turns into a dictator  they will appease him with free shit and get a hand into the marketalso  modi is trumps bitch india is resistant to sanctions to a certain extent it would also be beneficial for us in the long run earlier sanctions against india during the nuclear program helped in building local industries and increasing local technology economic sanctions will come but may not be for the reasons you have mentioned right wing and nationalism is rising across the world and this would result in more and more closing of borders in the name of protecting national interests this is what is going to affect global trade in the near future just my two cents wont happen unless china becomes less of a threat right now the us needs us kiska sanctions ? unsc or by us or by eu ?sanctions are placed only when a country possesses an immediate threat or is indulging in hr violationsand what will be restricted? travel ban  arms embargo  economic and tradesanctions work when other nations cooperate  eu sanctions crippled russia and un sanctions obliterated irans economy many small time journalists reporters to get ideas  roam around on social media  so are you one? to all the nay sayers dont be too confident about our geopolitical importance sanctions dont have to be big blanket bans today environmental clearances are no longer required for oil exploration  the way reliance works theyre gonna rape whatever site they will work on leading to a environmental catastrophe which could lead to sanctions it could be anything and our current govt is filled with incompetents everybody is jealous of indias rising statureis how this govt will justify to their followers who will lap it up without any thought,2020-02-05 19:51:49
AskIndia,what steps women can take for their safety  askindia ,416,e3ond3,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e3ond3/what_steps_women_can_take_for_their_safety/,194,time and again  we have so many incidents of crime against women india we cant have policemen or guardians accompanying women all the time  what all steps women can take in case of emergency few things that comes to my mind 1 carry pepper spray also  please do an emergency drill for using it 2 learn selfdefense martial arts 3 carry taser?4 always notify someone while traveling alone in cab auto share registration number of vehicle loudly on call  so that driver knows someone is aware of your whereabouts 5 in case you are stranded somewhere if traveling in a car  do lock all the windows and call the police  in case of 2 wheeler  just ditch it or ride with punctured tire to nearest petrol pump  toll  shop 6 never travel alone in an inebriate state please add your suggestionsedit  stranded not strangled,killer_unkill, this illusion of control is just that  an illusion even a guy wouldnt be able to defend himself against a group intent on overpowering him i dont know about safety but if you need to pass critical information in case of emergencies you can use automate app its an automation app you can do things with minimal interaction you can also add shortcuts to your home screen  so with one tap you can automate hell lot of things i use it daily and its a huge time saver for me so during emergencies where every second is crucial you can use that time to send as much as information to your friends and family members there are countless ideas on how you can use this app you play with this app for sometime and you will get itits a powerful app so use it with caution check the child lock  before getting into cab also protest  demand action hold the authorities accountable educate men speak out against lewd behavior  in person and whenever its portrayed in media avoid traveling alone in the night  especially in insecure areas request a colleague to accompany you if its unavoidable learn self defense or carry weaponsbut most important of all  do not give up your liberty most sexual violence is also intended to subjugate women and lower than standing in society fight for equality and your rightful place in society its sad to see the focus on totally different things in  the moment of tragedy no way a girl can overcome more than two guys unless she is a champion boxer or mixed martial artist instead of asking for police and judicial reforms and 911 like helpline number our focus is on how to make women learn self defense as far as pepper spray is concerned  here are some tips make sure there is no wind blowing towards you use it on the face of the suspect and flee immediately practice on a dummy in your balcony keep it in a keychain or somewhere easily accessible  if a security person asks what it is  you can say it is pocket deodorant  etc #x200b 1 if you are a concerned citizen and know of dark scary hostile regions in your neighhborhood  dont wait for a rape to happen to make that space safe it is immensely rewarding to fix lights and increase patrol before something bad happens  personal experience 2 if you know of any assaulters rapists in your friend group  ensure that everyone you know knows about them and they know they will always be watched dont bother with public opinion and women ruin lives with lies bs  keeping friends safe is key3 if you find out that your friends have been harassed or assaulted  ensure that anyone who victimblames them  or tries to discuss things they could have done to prevent shit is shown the door women spend hours anxious about their safety anyway  next steps are more important than what ifs keep names of legal advisors and therapists handy4 if your  friend  relative was assaulted as a child by some who is still a favoured relative  family friend  it is never to late for them to speak their truth support your person thought their journey  ensure that such predators dont ever prey on young people ever again keep an eye on them  publicly5 if you are at a wedding which serves alcohol  and notice rowdy behaviour  call it out yes  its someone elses joyful occasion  but drunken assaulters use alcohol  crowds and peoples hesitation to strike alert a few sober people and create a subtle surveillance system around people who arent in control6 people who survive assault rape may have ptsd ensure that your responses to news on sexual harassment  rape and abuse doesnt make them feel like shit it will make you part of their support system7 be the kind of human whose vulnerable friends would be comfortable and trusting enough to stay over with it saves livesthis is what i have to do  and have had to do carry a small concealable surgical blade make perpendicular slits carry a small knife and learn how to use it  learn how to use it and run away as quickly as you canhttps  youtube ewkjqcyapgshttps  youtube dvgc4rhb6zkhttps  youtube cbocizfnagchttps  youtube bxoscsokccs people have many good suggestions did not see this so adding one here  of course if under threat you need to reach out support  family friends or 100 assuming you have notified and are waiting for help to arrive and the bad folks have still not gotten to a stage where you are overpowered  start facebook live or livestreaming at least what happened or parts of it will be available to people to get some clues and you can also use it to tell the bad guys that your picture is now on internetwhile trying to capture either video or photos  make sure they are direct to internet  will need to set up your settings before hand  and you take a picture of the area as well as people  to the extent you can whenever my wife is alone in cab late nights she always calls me and keeps talking to me loudly throughout the ride she gives driver hints like i am a man and i will meet her at drop point also  she shares live location on whatsapp and i keep looking at it from time to time if you are ever thrown into the trunk of a car  kick out the back tail lights and stick your arm out the hole and start waving like crazy the driver wont see you  but everybody else will this has saved lives i carry a swiss army knife which my brother taught me to use  i still dont feel confident but hey its there  on my phone  through google maps  have set up location sharing with 2  people when taking an uber  have set up sharing of location i make it a point to inform my family the minute i start from and towards my homei always make it a point to call someone  or even fake call  the minute i am in an auto or car and day how much time roughly it will take me and that they can track mewhen on my bike  i am with other bikers so not alone and we travel long distance but not after sundown i understand the posts positive intention  but it is heartbreaking  that one has to do so much to just to stay safe and to carry on with their life  pursue their dreams and to live a normal existence in a society learn how you could use a ball pen  always keep a metal ball pen  target his eyes in times of puncture  do not ever worry about it damaging your bike  it will cause very minute damage  but that is totally worth than putting your life in danger you can go miles with your both tires punctured  not sure if you can go faster  i myself have driven my bike on a road trip after getting front tire punctured and the nearest village was 23 km away nothingall those precautions you have listed have time and again be used by different women throughout this country it is already a stifling atmosphere for women here and i will not blame them for migrating to other countries if they get the chanceas a man i have always loved my independence and the ability to just backpack and go somewhere on my own i have seldom thought what it is from the point of view of a woman and these recent sexual assault incidents just show a side of india which i have not personally experienced i am of the belief that death sentence and castration should be given to rapists especially for gang rape type incidents i have heard many times that death sentences dont act as a deterrent especially from law enforcement and human rights morons in this country but they are wrongdeath really does act as a deterrent especially with regard to the typical indian male to be frank  the average indian man is timid he doesnt have the courage to stand up for himself and doesnt have the courage to fight for his rights when such an individual is interacting with the opposite sex  he feels somewhat of an unknown power because in his mind women are of the weaker sex and come what may he will have power over her when such men group together  it can lead to disastrous consequences that is why gang rape is mostly a phenomenon of south asian countries and few war torn african countriesthese same indian men go to foreign countries such as the middle east and europe but they avoid doing the same there why? because they have fear of the law our judicial system is overseen by old men and women who can be called dinosaurs in this day and age its all nice for the liberal elite to copy the practices of foreign countries debating whether death penalty is ethical or not while forgetting the demographic differences between the people of our country and foreigners especially with regarding to race   iq and upbringing lets face it most indians are uncivilized and therefore for uncivilized people stringent laws are applicable barring instances of being innocently charged  we could do with some culling of the population  especially some men emigrate love how the conversation after a catastrophic incident is always about how not to get raped how to defend yourself against rapists instead ya know the initiators of the horrific acts best they can do is fuck off from this awful country and settle to some other where they aint seen as  consumable  asking women to take safety precautions is fine but the real way to stop rapes is to well  stop men from raping#x200b unpopular opinion but we need to make an example out of the perpetrators of these vicious crimes you can say this is my outrage but these perpetrators do not deserve human rights since they have proved by their acts that they do not deserve to be called human i am not suggesting a mob lynching here but the law must be extremely strict for rape in this country people need to know that if they commit rape  they will be found out and they will be reprimanded severely  further all the netas who have rape cases against them need to be brought to book we need to set the example that no matter how high and mighty you are  rape in india is a serious offenceand of course mental health being exposed to pornography and item songs in a society where  conversations about sex are taboo is another reason why there are so many rapes in india we need a sex education and mental health programmme that has better outreachthe outraged me says chauk pe khada kar saalo ko  baaki sab hum dekh lenge,2019-11-30

Non-Political,i find r india circlejerking too much over shashi tharoor whenever he reproaches the evils of the british raj here is an alternative perspective from gurcharan das  non political ,155,6zeuk0,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6zeuk0/i_find_rindia_circlejerking_too_much_over_shashi/,115,here is the original link of the articlehttps  gurcharandasorg richnationpoorindia how a rich nation became poor and will be rich againessays  march 19  2007  1238 developing cultures  case studies  coedited by peter berger and laurence harrison  routledge  2005 does culture in some way help to explain the fact that the same indian economy that was stagnating for the first fifty years of the 20th century began to grow at a respectable clip after 1980 and was amongst the fastest growing in the world by the end of the century?consider the following hundred year trend between 1900 and 1950  the indian economy grew on the average 08 percent a year  but the population also grew at about the same rate  thus  net growth in income per capita was nil and we rightly called our colonial economy stagnant after independence  economic growth picked up to 35 percent between 1950 and 1980  but so did population growth  to 22 percent   hence the net affect on income was 13 percent per capita  and this is what we mournfully referred to as the hindu rate of growth things began to change with modest liberalization in the eighties when annual economic growth rose to 56 percent this happy trend continued in the reform decade of the nineties when growth averaged 62 percent a year  while population slowed to 18 percent  thus  per capita income rose by a decent 44 percent a yearas a benchmark  recall that the wests industrial revolution took place at a 3 percent gdp growth and 11 percent per capita income growth after 1820 to appreciate the magnitude of the indian change after 1980  let me illustrate if indias per capita gdp had continued growing at the pre1980 level  then its income would have reached present american capita income levels only by 2250  but if it continues to grow at the post1980 rate then it will reach those levels by 2066 a gain of 184 yearshow does one begin to explain indias economic performance over the past hundred years? the indian nationalist blames the first fifty years stagnation on british colonialism but a trade economist will counter this by showing that the world economy was also stagnant in the first half of the 20th century  especially after world war i  when world per capita gdp grew annually at just under one percent2the main culprits  he would say  were conflict and autarky disgraceful protectionism by most governments between the wars slowed both the world and the indian economyalthough the indian economy picked up after 1950  the neoclassical economist would argue that it performed below the world economy  which experienced a golden age driven by trade expansion until 1971 like the rest of the third world india did not benefit from global trade expansion because it had closed its economy and pursued import substitution moreover  nehrus socialism had shackled the economy with fierce controls on the private sector  pejoratively called licence raj  hence its annual gdp growth was 15 percentage points below even the third world average between 1950 and 19803this changed dramatically with modest liberal reforms in the 1980s and more sweeping ones in the 1990s as the indian economy integrated with the world in those twenty years it not only outperformed the world economy significantly but it was amongst the fastest in the world4thus  gradual technological diffusion  rising capital accumulation and productivity  and gradual education expansion help economists to explain a good deal of the story there is also the value of time and accumulated learning through time collective learning is hayeks term  and he applied it to the cumulative experience that generations build up which is embodied in the language  the technology  and the way of doing things5but economic explanations are not enough that india adopted democracy in 1950 before capitalism  in 1991  is also significant because democracys redistributive pressures  such as free power to farmers and other subsidies  have dampened growth and also explain why indias reform process has been so painfully slow economists also find it puzzling why the liberal institutions of the british raj did not engender faster growth during the colonial years the rule of law  the relative peace of pax brittanica  a nondirigiste administration  the railways and canalsall these were market friendly moves  after alli believe that national confidence also plays an important role the more damaging impact of colonialism may well have been to indian mindsit created an inferiority complex from which they have only recently recovered douglass north has rightly emphasized the importance of beliefs6businessmen understand the value of confidence in entrepreneurial success and in creating a climate for investment  historians too emphasize the power of selfbelief in national successroman history and britains rise in the 19th century are examples of this after independence  indias confidence certainly rose  especially as democracy took root  but flawed economic institutions of nehruvian socialism damaged that confidence once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the reform period  confidence returned and young indian minds finally became decolonized i traveled extensively across india in the 1990s when i discovered this changed mood  and i think it also explains the current economic success7i shall now amplify my arguments by taking the reader on a galloping tour of indian economic history from this story i shall draw lessons about the role of institutions and culture in development en passant  i shall touch upon the great questions of indian history did the british impoverish india? why didnt the railways engender an industrial revolution? did nehrus socialism dampen indias progress? what is the consequence of democracy preceding capitalism?lets begin with the mughalsindias nationalist historians have portrayed its precolonial economy as a golden age of prosperity  and this fabulous wealth set the europeans on their great voyages of discovery8during the mughal empire at the end of the 16th century  indias wealth did indeed sustain more than 100 million people with plenty of arable land  its agriculture was certainly as productive as western europes  and even the subsistenceoriented peasant got a decent return9india also had a large  skilled workforce that produced not only cotton but also luxuries for the aristocracy consequently  the economy produced a large financial surplus  which was used to support the growing mughal empire and finance spectacular monuments like the taj mahal10in 1497  the portuguese sent vasco da gama with a flotilla of four ships to find indias wealth but the twoyear voyage was not a commercial success and the indians were not interested in european clothes and goods for they made far ones in india but da gama told king manuel of portugal of large cities  large buildings and rivers  and great populations he spoke about spices and jewels  precious stones and mines of gold he believed that he had found indias legendary wealth11it took the english a hundred years to discover this wealth initially  they came to plunder but soon discovered the rewards of trade they found that india produced the worlds best cotton yarn and textiles and in enormous quantities12what the indians wanted in exchange from the europeans was gold and silver  for which they had an insatiable appetite hence  there was a constant flow of gold to india  which absorbed a good deal of the bullion mined by the spaniards in the new world having learned about cotton textiles from india  the english turned the tables  and brought an industrial revolution to britain  but destroyed the lives of millions of indian weaversindia was a leading manufacturer in the 18th centuryindia was a leading manufacturing country in the world in the early 18th century it had 226 percent share of the worlds gdp  which came down to around 16 percent by 1820  closer to its share of world population13it had a developed banking system and vigorous merchant capital  with a network of agents  brokers and middlemen given the enormous financial surplus  a skilled artisan class  large exports  plenty of arable land and reasonable productivity  the question is why didnt a modern industrial economy emerge in india? instead  why did india become impoverished?despite a dynamic and a growing commercial sector which responded to market forces and extensive foreign trade  the truth is that 18th century india was significantly behind western europe in technology  institutions and ideas neither an agricultural revolution  nor a scientific revolution had occurred  and in the long run the manual skill of the indian artisan could be no substitute for technological progress 14and this would have needed new attitudes notwithstanding the surplus and the trade  mideighteenth india had a per capita product perhaps twothirds of that in england and france15there is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor one explanation is that even in the 18th century india had a large population and plenty of cheap labor prosperity comes with rising productivity and a rise in productivity depends on technology when the supply of labor is elastic  it is more economical to hire people than to invest in machines hence  an englishman observed in 1807  in india it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labour16there is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor one explanation is that even in the 18 century india had a large population and plenty of cheap labor prosperity comes with rising productivity and a rise in productivity depends on technology when the supply of labor is elastic  it is more economical to hire people than to invest in machines hence  an englishman observed in 1807  in india it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labourdid the british raj impoverish india?indias nationalist historians have blamed the british raj for indias poverty the classic nationalist case is that india had been rich before the british came and colonialism weakened agriculture and deindustrialized india  throwing millions of artisans out of work britains trade policies encouraged the import of manufactures and the export of raw materials  finally  it drained the wealth of india by transferring its capital to britainnationalists claimed that lancashires new textile mills crushed indias handloom textile industry and threw millions of weavers out of work indias textile exports plunged from a leadership position before the start of the britains industrial revolution to a fraction the indigenous banking system  which financed these exports  was also destroyed since the colonial government did not erect tariff barriers  indian consumers shifted to cheaper english millmade cloth and millions of handloom workers where left in misery british colonial rule deindustrialised india  a favorite nationalist phrase  and from an exporter of textiles  india became an exporter of raw cotton17britain also changed the old land revenue system to the disadvantage of the farmer  who had to now pay revenue whether or not the monsoon failed this led to famines the worst one in 189697 affected 96 million lives and killed an estimated 5 million people although the railways helped in the trade of food crops  the enlarged national market sucked away the peasants surplus  which he had earlier stored for the bad years moreover  the british government transferred its surplus revenues back to england since india consistently exported more then she imported in the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century  britain used indias trade surplus to finance her own trade deficit with the rest of the world  to pay for her exports to india  and for capital repayments in london this represented a massive drain of indias wealth18in recent years some historians have challenged this nationalist picture they have argued that indian industrys decline in the 19th century was caused by technology the machines of britains industrial revolution wiped out indian textiles  in the same way that traditional handmade textiles disappeared in europe and the rest of the world fifty years later indian textile mills would have destroyed them indias weavers were  thus  the victims of technological obsolescence19they also found that the land tax had not been exorbitantby 1900 it was only 5 percent of the agricultural output or half the average per capita tax burden there had been a drain of wealth  but it was only about 15 percent of gnp every year the revisionist historians argued that indias payments to britain were for real military and civilian services and to service capital investments also  the overhead cost of the british establishmentthe so called home chargeswas in fact quite small20if india had its own army and navy it would have spent more true  india did have a balance of payments surplus  which britain used to finance part of her deficit  but india was compensated by the import of gold and silver that went into private indian handsindia begins to reindustrizeindian entrepreneurs began to set up their own modern textile mills after 1850 and very slowly began to recapture the domestic market in 1896  indian mills supplied 8 of the total cloth consumed in india  in 1913  20  in 1936  62  and by 1945  7621although india did not participate in global trade expansion between 1870 and 1913  indian businessmen made large profits during the first world war  which they reinvested in after the war thus  indias manufacturing output grew 56 percent per year between 191338  well above the world average of 33 percent22the british government finally provided tariff protection from the 1920s  which helped industrialists to expand and diversifyby independence in 1947  indian entrepreneurs were strong and in a position to buy out the businesses of the departing british industrys share in indias gnp had doubled from 38 percent  in 1913  to 75 percent  in 1947   and the share of manufactures in her exports rose from 224 percent  in 1913  to 30 percent  in 1947 why didnt an industrial revolution occur?one of the intriguing questions of history is why india failed to create an industrial revolution karl marx predicted that the railways would transform india and usher in an industrial revolution indeed  by the first world war  some thought that it was ready to takeoff by 1914  india had the third largest railway network  the worlds largest jute manufacturing industry  the fourth largest cotton textile industry  the largest canal system  and 25 percent of world trade23although a colony  it had a very liberal regulatory regimefar more investor friendly than the one that replaced it after independenceand after the 1920s the infant industry was also favored by tariffs it had a merchant class hungry to become industrialists industrialization did  in fact  pick up after the war and industrys share in national output doubled but it was not enough to broadly transform an agricultural society modern industry employed only 25 million people out of population of 350 millionamiya kumar bagchi  the marxist economist  suggests that the reason was the lack of effective demand during the colonial period  and this limited business opportunity indians were just too poor to buy modern goods and services24if the domestic indian market was small  couldnt the entrepreneur have supplemented it by producing for export? morris d morris  blames supply constraints25an indian entrepreneur was uncompetitive because of a shortage of technology  skilled labor  and capitalall of which raised his cost of his production the historian  rajat ray  argues that indian businessmen did not export because they made inferior products  unacceptable to the world market in his view  technological backwardness was the single biggest failing26but surely  they could have imported technology  as jamshedji tata  gd birla  and others didunlike nationalist historians  i do not think there was a british conspiracy to deliberately underinvest in india or sabotage indian business interests bombays textile mills were built with the credit  technical assistance and machines from britain although they were a competitive threat to the manchesters mills i believe the industrial revolution did not occur because indian agriculture remained stagnant  and you cannot have an industrial revolution without an agricultural surplus or the means to feed a rapidly growing urban population  second  the international trading environment turned hostile with protectionism after the first world war  followed by the depression  third  the colonial government did not educate the masses  unlike the japanese state  finally  a colonial mindset pervaded the indian middle classeven the hardiest potential entrepreneur lacks confidence when he is politically enslavedwhat is the verdict on british rule?did the british impoverish india? there is no question that in the 18th century it plundered and looted indias wealth  as all conquerors have done in history but did it create ongoing institutions that were to indias detriment? this has to do with the nature and theory of colonialism true  its industrial revolution threw millions of weavers out of work  but it would have happened any way when the new technology reached india british government policy could have cushioned the impact by erecting trade barriers and saved enormous amount of human suffering  but protecting handlooms would have been a temporary palliativeodd as it may seem  i believe that britain did not exploit india enough had it made the massive investments in india that it did in the americas  india would have become more prosperous and a much bigger market for british goods a richer india would have been a better customer  a better supplier  and a firmer basis of empire27britains main failure was not to educate the indian masseshence 83 percent of indians were illiterate at independence britains education system in india produced only a thin upper crust of extremely well educated indians  while the masses remained illiterate28although britain could not lift indians out of poverty  nor avert famines  it did give india the institutions of democracythe rule of law  an independent judiciary and a free press it built railways  canals  and harbors it gave india almost a hundred years of peacethe pax britannica although it gave modern values and institutions  it did not interfere with its ancient traditions and religion hence  india has preserved its spiritual heritage and the old way of life continues many despair over the divisiveness of caste  but the hold of the indian way of life is also a bulwark against the onslaught of the global cultureindependence and license rajafter independence  democracy took root in india and gradually the masses acquired a stake in the system  periodically electing representatives even from the lowest castes the rulers also adopted a fabian socialist economic path  and indians did not turn to capitalism until 1991  although there was modest liberalization of the economy in the 1980s thus  india embraced democracy before capitalism  which makes its journey to modernity unique and explains a good dealjawaharlal nehru and his planners did not trust private entrepreneurs  so they made the state the entrepreneur  and not surprisingly  they failed to create an industrial revolution instead  india experienced an agricultural revolution in the early 1970s it thus had an important precondition for the industrial revolutionan agricultural surplusbut the industrial takeoff eluded it its investment rate also rose from 6 percent to well over 20 per cent  and yet it did not engender a takeoff why?i think there were at least six things wrong with indias mantra one  it adopted an inwardlooking  importsubstituting path rather than an outwardlooking  exportpromoting route  it thus denied itself a share in world trade and the prosperity that trade brought in the postwar era two  it set up a massive  inefficient  and monopolistic public sector to which it denied autonomy of working  hence  its investments were not productive and it had a poor capitaloutput ratio three  it overregulated private enterprise with the worst controls in the world  and this diminished competition in the market  four  it discouraged foreign capital and denied itself the benefits of technology and world class competition five  it pampered organized labor to the point that it has extremely low productivity six  it ignored the education of its childrennehrus strategic planner  pc mahalanobis  made two wrong assumptions he assumed that there were no opportunities for rapid export expansion in the 1950s  and this turned out to be wrong india discovered that tiny hong kong could earn more from its exports than the whole of india  as indias share of world trade declined from 22 percent in 1947 to 05 percent in 1990 he also assumed that competition was wasteful  and this was also a flawed idea because there can be little improvement in productivity without iteven more damaging were the creeping controls on the private sector the most bizarre was the licensing system it began with the industrial licensing act of 1951  which required an entrepreneur to get a license to set up a new unit  to expand it  or change the product mix a huge number of untrained clerks  engineers  bureaucrats at the directorate general of technical development  operating on the basis of inadequate information vetted thousands of applications on an ad hoc basis these low level functionaries took months in the futile  microreview of an application and finally sent it for approval to the administrative ministry the ministry again lost months reviewing the same data before it sent the application to an interministerial licensing committee after the ministers approval  the investor had to seek approval for the import of machinery from the capital goods licensing committee if finance was needed from a state financial institution  the same scrutiny had to be repeated afresh the result was enormous delays  sometimes lasting years with staggering opportunities for corruptionlarge business houses set up parallel bureaucracies in delhi  to follow up on their files  organize bribes  and win licenses if the entrepreneur did finally get started and made a success of his enterprise  he was again in trouble it was an offence punishable under the law to manufacture beyond the capacity granted by the license india became the only country in the world where the production of sorely needed goods sorely was punishable by law29the system ended in thwarting competition  entrepreneurship and growth  without achieving any of its social objectives it fostered monopolies and it proliferated uneconomicsize plants in remote  uncompetitive locations  employing secondrate technology bureaucrats who did not have a clue about the basics of running a business made the decisions on the choice of technology  the size and location of plantsalthough it was becoming clear that india was on the wrong path by the late sixties  instead of changing course after nehru  indira gandhi introduced more controls she nationalized banks  discouraged foreign investment  and placed more hurdles before domestic enterprise hence  industrial growth plunged from 77 per cent a year between 19511965 to 40 per cent between 19661980 productivity of indian manufacturing declined half a percent a year from 1960 to 19853019661980 is effectively the dark period for the indian economy31 it is harder to blame nehru for adopting the economic wrong model for socialism was the wisdom of his age and dozens of economists visited india and hailed his bold experiment32it is right to blame indira gandhi  for by then japans miracle was evident  and korea and taiwan were following its footsteps however  ideology is only one part of the story an important reason for nonperformance was poor implementation even nehrus socialism could have delivered more and did not have to degenerate into license rajindia after the reformsalthough there was modest liberalization in the 1980s  the decisive turning point came in july 1991 when the minority government of narasimha rao announced sweeping reforms it opened the economy to foreign investment and trade  it dismantled import controls  lowered customs duties  devalued the currency and made the rupee convertible on the trade account  it virtually abolished licensing controls on private investment  dropped tax rates and broke public sector monopolies as a result growth rose to 75 percent a year for three years in a row in the midnineties  inflation came down from 13 percent to 6 percent by 1993  exchange reserves shot up from 1 billion to 20 billion by 1993  and had crossed 100 billion by end 2003 this was as important a turning point as dengs revolution in china in december 1978 surprisingly  the elected coalition governments that succeeded rao continued the reform process  and despite its slow  incremental pace  it has made india one of the fastest growing major economies in the world33indians have traditionally not accorded a high place to making money hence  the merchant or bania is placed third in the fourcaste hierarchy  behind the brahmin and the kshatriya  and only a step ahead of the laboring shudra after the economic reforms making money became increasingly respectable and the sons of brahmins and kshatriyas began to get mbas and wanted to become entrepreneurs the business pages of newspapers became livelier  chief ministers in the states scrambled for private investment  judges became more evenhanded in industrial disputes as a result  india is in the midst of a social revolution rivalled  perhaps  only by the ascent of japans merchant class during the 1968 meiji restorationthere has also been mental revolution and a changed attitude to english illustrates this new mindset ever since the british left indians constantly carped against the english language but in the 1990s this carping seemed to die  and quietly  without ceremony english became one of the indian languages english lost its colonial stigma  oddly enough  around the time that the hindu nationalists came to power young indians in the new middle class think of english as a skill  like windows this is why hinglish  hindi mixed with english  is spreading encouraged by flourishing private television channels and supported by their advertisers  the newly emerging middle classes avidly embrace this uninhibited hybrid of hindi and english  and this popular idiom of the bazaar is rushing down the socioeconomic ladder the purists naturally disapprove  but people are more comfortable and accepting of it today because indians are more relaxed and confident as a people their minds have become decolonizedthe world  meanwhile  also changed from an industrial to the information economy  and it seemed to speak to indias advantage  symbolized by its success in software and business process outsourcing these bangalores have given indians confidence and they reflect a new social contract the new entrepreneurs did not inherit wealth  they have risen on the back of their talent  hard work  and professional skills a new selfbelief has emerged among urban youth that doesnt need approval from others  especially from the west music composers like ar rehman display an exuberant nonchalance  as do the new young bollywood pop stars so do new fiction writers like arundhati roy  designers of fashion clothes  beauty queens and cricket starssome lessonsneoclassical economic theory explains a great deal about why the indian economy that was stagnating in the first half of the 20th century went on to become one of the fastest growing by the end of the century it tells us  for example  that disgraceful protectionism by governments in the interwar years in the first half of the 20th century dampened world trade and slowed down the world and the indian economies it also explains why india performed below the world average between 19501980 thinking that trade had impoverished her in the colonial period  india closed its economy and denied itself the fruits of a golden period in world trade between 1950 and 1970  license raj and other institutions of nehrus socialism also suppressed growth finally  neoclassical economics explains how by dismantling controls and integrating the economy with the global economy  the indian economy has become more competitive and is growing rapidly after the reformsbut this is not the whole story  and we must turn to institutions and attitudes to understand the incentive structure of the indian society60 indians blame colonialism for impoverishing them but we have seen that colonialism is a more complex tale for example  it did not deindustrialize india as the nationalists argued  handloom textiles died in india  and the world  because of technological obsolescence colonialisms bigger damage was to the loss of indian confidence  which inhibited indian entrepreneurs this confidence began to grow with gandhis freedom movement in the first half of the 20th century  and industrialization did pick up however  its impact on society was insufficient to create an industrial revolutionafter independence  indias confidence certainly rose as democracy took root  but flawed economic institutions of nehruvian socialism acted as a damper once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the reform period  selfassurance returned to the indian marketplace todays mood in india is opposite to what existed a hundred years ago insecurity and inferiority filled colonial india  which is all too apparent in the writings of bengali writers of the 19th century  such as bankim chandra chatterji today  writers like salman rushdie and arundhati roy exhibit a matter of fact assuredness  almost a cool  that is a reflection of changed national mindsetindia embraced democracy first and capitalism afterwards and this has made a difference india became a fullfledged democracy in 1950  with universal suffrage and extensive human rights  but it was not until 1991 that it opened up to the free play of market forces for the rest of the world it has been the other way around in the west  suffrage was extended gradually in the last century  and as mass political parties developed  democracy began to impinge on capitalist institutions and practicesindias democracy has an overwhelming majority of poor voters70 per cent still live in rural areas  organized labor constitutes less than 10 per cent of total labor  and the middle class is around 20 per cent of the population because of democratic pressures  india tried to redistribute the pie before it was baked it set up intricate regulatory networks before the private economy had transformed a rural into an industrial society it began to think in terms of welfare before there were welfaregenerating jobs the result  as we have seen  was a throttling of enterprise  slow growth  and missed opportunities it is the price india has paid for having democracy before capitalismor rather too much democracy and not enough capitalismsince politics is a short run game and growth is a long run one there will never be a situation that is completely optimal this explains why indian politicians do not bother about education because results take a long time to come when a politician promises rice for two rupees a kilo when it costs five rupees in the market  he wins the election since the mid1960s politicians have vigorously competed in giving away free goods and services to voters when politicians do that  where is the money to come for creating schools or improving old ones? indias damaging fiscal deficit  around 10 percent of gdp for the center and states combined  is a testimonial to the downside of competitive politics  and it teaches that the demand for publicly provided goods and services is insatiable in a democracybut indias problems of governance go far beyond the need to appease interests the weakening of its democratic institutions since indira gandhi in the 1970s has caused widespread corruption  political violence  populist giveaways  and a paralysis of problem solving conspicuously absent are disciplined party organizations  which help leaders in other democracies to mobilize support for specific programs hence  there is an excessive reliance on the personal appeal of individual leaders to win elections when in power leaders tend to take the easy way out  which is not to act at allwill capitalism  and its cousin globalization succeed in establishing a comfortable place for themselves in india? the answer depends on their ability to deliver prosperity broadly it also depends on leaders in the government and in business to champion the classic liberal premises of free trade and competition it needs leaders to come out say that  1  some people will not fare as well in the competitive market place   2  the winners will far outnumber the losers   2  capitalist democracy is the best arrangement we have found   4  globalization is not only a good thing  it is a great leap forward in history my fear is that capitalisms success in india is threatened not so much by the leftists or protectionists but by the timidity of its defendersthe curious historic inversion between democracy and capitalism means that indias path into the future is evolving through a daily dialogue between the conservative forces of caste  religion and the village  the leftist and nehruvian socialist forces which dominated the intellectual life of the country for 40 years  and the new forces of global capitalism these million negotiations of democracy slow down the pace of economic reforms  but they also mean that india might have a more stable  peaceful  and negotiated transition into the future than say china it might also avoid some of the deleterious side effects of an unprepared capitalist society  such as russia although slower  india is more likely to preserve its way of life and its civilization of diversity  tolerance  and spirituality against the onslaught of the global culturedoes culture matter?cultural explanations have been a vigorous industry in india for more than a hundred years colonial officials routinely blamed indias poverty on the otherworldly spirituality of hindu life and its fatalistic beliefs max weber attributed the absence of development to the caste system gunnar myrdal  the swedish economist  found that indias social system and attitudes were an important cause of its low level equilibrium of low productivity  primitive production techniques  and low levels of living34deepak lal  another economist  similarly explained economic stagnation in a low level hindu equilibrium around the caste system  which bought stability in the context of political warfare  monsoon failure and climatic uncertainty  labor shortage  and an undervalued merchant class35david landes  the historian  blames the enervating heat  which is deleterious to work for this reason  rich countries lie in temperate zones and the poor in the tropics and semitropics36while institutions and culture do matter undoubtedly  we are all skeptical of national stereotypes and easy cultural explanations of the sort that were common hundred years ago in my experience  successful hindu entrepreneurs can be both extremely otherworldly in religion and aggressive in business the indian farmer  despite being caught in the caste system  responds quickly to market based incentives  as the green revolution testifies brahmins  who are supposed to have contempt for manual labor  will plough their land vigorously if they have to and rajput thakurs  who never worked for a living  will shed their feudal ways for the sake of a commercial opportunity moreover  there are substantial nonhindus in india and these communities had also been stuck in the same rut of stagnation other asian countries were equally backward  but they had no hindu equilibrium to explain away their stagnation finally  the same indians when they migrate to other countries perform betterthus  i am uncomfortable with the otherworldly values of the hindus or the immobilizing effects of the caste system and the conservative habits of the merchant caste i believe that sir john hicks economic principle does trump in most cases it states that people would act economically  when the opportunity of an advantage was presented to them they would take it37it explains not only the diffusion of the green revolution across india but also the demographic transitions currently underway in many stateswhen seeking an explanation for a nations wealth and poverty  my preferred method is to begin with economic factors as proximate causes that motivate a businessman to investthe size of the market  the capability of suppliers  distribution hurdles  and the state of competition if this does not satisfy  i seek answers in institutions  some of which are  of course  intimately tied to culture i have found that institutions can evolve rapidly as incentives change in society and can be transferred fairly quickly  for example  during the 1990s india was able to dismantle many of the institutions of nehruvian socialism and replace them with capitalist institutions finally  if none of these factors provide a satisfactory explanation  then i turn to attitudes and social structurei find deepak lalls distinction between material and cosmological beliefs useful38the material beliefs of a civilization are about ways of making a living and are the subject of economics  cosmological ones are about how to live and are in the realm of culture the rise of the west was accompanied by a change in both sets of beliefs  but east asias success has needed mainly a change in material beliefsit has become prosperous without losing its soul in other words  it is possible to modernize without westernizing ever since the british raj material beliefs have been changing in india unlike our cosmological beliefsour continuing inability to distinguish between the modern and the western in india is surely the cause of some of our grief if we could only accept that a great deal of modern western culture  especially its material beliefs  are not the wests property  but are a universal  critical way of thinking  which belongs to all rational human beings we would not waste our energies on swadeshi  protectionism  hindutva  preserving the ancient hindu civilization   and futile language debates  remove english from primary schools  the debate between modernisation and westernisation  begun in early nineteenth century by ram mohan roy  continues to rage in india at the root is a fear of the loss of the indian way of life the older generation fears it more than the young  whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the wests material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones,unfitforoffice, wow tldr?  deleted   deleted  i dont think thats what tharoor is really talking about more from the perspective of hitler is taught to be an evil guy now in germany as well yet  britain has mostly whitewashed the horrors theyve committed in what they teach to their own kids continuing the same stuff  imho  hes raising awareness about the atrocities that theyve committed  and thats something i can get behind i think tharoors main goal is to educate the modern western masses about some of the harsher realities of colonialism  that they conveniently leave out in their history text books this was an interesting counter narrative as well das essentially wrote the same thing in india unbound but i dont think it really contradicts tharoors claims  everyone of das arguments are well corroborated in partly being responsible for holding india back but he lets the brits go scott freeyes  there were individual entrepreneurial success stories  too few benefited  yes  the european institutions enabled the industrial revolution and yes  the caste system was responsible but without a indian structural head who couldve changed things or we couldve had an enlightment  a historical whatif   the colonial masters simply gave  no chance for growth that carries a lot of culpability the drain theory is definitely true the eic was paying 400 000 pounds to the crown since 1765 apart from the gifts to parliament all sourced from india they took advantage of aurgazebs tax exemption the marathas  nawab of awadh and hyderabads nizam all had to pay substantial amounts annually to the french and eic well before 1857 asafuddaula paid 76 million rupees annually just to be recognised nawab in 1797 the point is  the money couldve been spent on subjects or institutions and maybe we wouldnt be as poor as we are nowa book came out last year called selling empire india in the making of britain and america  16001830 which demonstrates the centrality of indiaboth as an idea and a placeto the making of a global british imperial system essentially  the new world was discovered because columbus was searching for riches in india he makes the argument that in the runup to the american revolution  the east india company played a visible and disturbing role in his view  americans awareness of the companys conquests in india  and the establishment of an authoritarian government there  evoked the fear of a shared place for indians and americans in a corrupt and despotic empire  following the revolution  americas connection with india paradoxically expanded  as reflected in part by the continuing appeal of indian consumer fashions much of it  however  arose fortuitously out of the extended british wars with france from 1794 onward  as a neutral power  the united states was well situated to take advantage of trading opportunities denied to others by 1806  india had contributed 4 percent of us imports  and americans commanded much of the continental european market for indian goods  it gave india almost a hundered years of peace im done i wouldnt call 100+ of looting and injustice peaceful have read the whole thingthe nehruvian disaster is irrelevant for judging the british periodtaking information from the article itself  i think we can still blame the british for not letting india join the industrial revolutionthis they did by creatinglow literacy education  in a modern economy  this alone will mean that youll fail to compete unstable political environment  low confidence  in an uncertain future  why will anyone invest time and capital  there is a mention of low self confidence and lack of education being the reason indians didnt moved toward industrialization and he also mentioned that indians had no money to buy anything at that time then how after 1947 suddenly things could have changed? isnt these things require time especially a skills gained after education i think once a generation of indian educated enough in 1980s they automatically moved towards the industrialization solely on the basis of there skills and of course we cant deny the poor government policies but i feel completely blaming them isnt right  a thing is there something wrong i have understood from this article? saved for later too long to read right now lets just sum it up the british did many good things and bad thingspersonally im glad for stuff like outlawing sati and reforming personal laws which im sure most of our post independence governments wouldnt have the guts to touch was india ever a rich nation in the first place? people use the 27 of world gdp stat to justify the label but we had 27 of the world population also at that time both shashi tharoor and gurcharan das are starting from the flawed premise that we were a rich nation  slightly off topic  but i believe much of tharoors british bashing is just shrewd political posturing when he first ran for parliament in 2009  the nair community voted for him en masse because he is one of us the educated liberal class voted for him because he had the it factor  undersecretary general of the un  erudite  sophisticated etc he won handily  with a huge margin in 2014  a lot of the older nairs voted bjp because they stand for hindu values  evidence for this is anectodal  everyone in my  +wifes  family voted tharoor in 2009  most of our parents generation voted bjp in 2014  tharoor still had the youth liberal vote and won  but by a margin that was an order of magnitude less compared to 2009 a huge slide in 2019  he faces the prospect of running against suresh gopi  popular actor  current bjp rs mp   and stands a real risk of losing i consider his antibrit stance an attempt at pandering to the nationalistic crowdit is really simplistic to claim britain looted us or caused millions of deaths due to famine without considering how much of indias wealth was concentrated in the hands of zamindars  nawabs and rajas or taking into account the lives lost in wars between the various kingdoms and city states that dotted the indian subcontinent before the british brought it all together well tharoor is not completely wrong either india was rich  maybe not as rich as all those whatsapp forwards mention like 27 of world gdp and other crap i also believe that tharoors fans are a little bit exaggerating his debates and speeches i think hes going to use this wave of false patriotism thats been around which makes people patriots on social media  to his advantage in the next elections i mean  no one really discusses if a robbery is overall a good thing even if it did help turn someones life around in a positive way   the older generation fears it more than the young  whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the wests material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological onesas ive been trying to explain to the languagetards on all sides  accepting english is decolonization glad to see an academic agree i can drink his urine straight from source brilliant learned a lot about myself and my country  brilliant article its important to see good arguments from both sides thanks for sharing,2017-09-12 01:15:04

Non-Political,the forgotten promise of 1949 the rss wrote a nonpolitical role for itself as part of an undertaking it gave sardar patel the overt political role it has assumed in 2013 is a breach of that agreement and its own constitution  oct2013,161,8e198n,http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/the-forgotten-promise-of-1949/article5211026.ece,10,nan,bliss_tree,  the rashtriya swayamsevak sanghs constitution explicitly states that it will stay clear of politics the constitution itself was written  in 1949  because sardar vallabhbhai patel would have it no other way  the unstated part of the bjprss relationship was that the sangh chief  sarsanghchalak in rss parlance  himself would not show his hand the behindthescenes role for the minder was necessitated both by the 1949 undertaking to patel and to overcome the strong political opposition to hindutva the governments of 19771979 and 19982004 became possible only because the rss agreed to keep out of sight  cut to 1949 and the rsss undertaking to patel to write a constitution  which  among other things  would specify that the sangh had no politics and would remain devoted purely to cultural work  article 4 b  of the rss constitution  dr goyal  1979  the written constitution was patels precondition for lifting the ban imposed on the rss in the wake of mahatma gandhis january 30  1948 assassination  on november 14  1948  the home ministry held by patel issued a press note which said golwalkar wanted the ban lifted without agreeing to the governments demand that the rss reform itself further  the note quoted information received from the provincial governments  which showed that the activities carried on in various forms and ways by the people associated with the rss tend to be antinational and often subversive and violent and that persistent attempts are being made by the rss to revive an atmosphere in the country which was productive of such disastrous consequences in the past  the letter of september 11  1948  was to golwalkar himself in this patel lauded the rss for its service to hindu society even as he outlined the objectionable part which arose when they  burning with revenge  began attacking mussalmaans  further  as a final result of the  communal  poison  the country had to suffer the sacrifice of the invaluable life of gandhiji  patel said peoples opposition to the rss grew when the rss men expressed joy and distributed sweets after gandhijis death well power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely   dont remember who said that  but it fits here  any lawyers around? is it possible for a court to cast out the leadership of rss and give control of the organization to an external administration? if an organization is clearly in breach of its charter and principles  and the current governance structure takes no notice surely thats grounds for dismissing the leadership? so  complain to sardar patel?   oathbreakers,2018-04-22 18:37:20

Non-Political, nonpolitical  serious  whats your thoughts on gst now?,34,6izxwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6izxwj/nonpoliticalserious_whats_your_thoughts_on_gst_now/,10,1st of all  im not looking for political circlejerking im looking for neutral viewpoint and dispassionate analysis i personally believe if you passionately hate or support something  you lose the objectivityi think its a step in right direction however  there is a lot of scope for improvement i have couple of points to add please correct me if im wrong and share your valuable insights also  comprehensive study articles papers is most welcome for starters  the rates are quite confusing and i spoke with a ca guy  he thinks there are a lot confusion as of now so i think we can say its in beta phase after the implementation  govt would need to sort out various issues and make sure it increases the efficiency also  i think rates for various items have been decided in haste and randomly so  that has to be addressed after the implementation i think it doesnt solve the central issue police at the state borders will make other excuses to stop trucks and demand bribes one of my relatives is truck transporter if the driver doesnt pay the bribe  police simply break their headlights and then charge the fine this is a lot common in this respect  gst barely helps in faster movements of goods since petroleum and alcohol has been kept out of gst  police can stop trucks to check these items its far from one tax one nation the proposed tax structure includes a central gst  a state gst and an interstate gst given the current structure  if a person does business in three states  he has to get six registrations and make a number of regulatory filings the central gst bill allows the central government to set up an antiprofiteering authority by law  or designate an existing authority to carry out the functions  the authority will be responsible for ensuring that the reduction of tax rates on account of implementation of gst results in a commensurate reduction in prices  india has had bad experience with new monitoring bodies i am afraid this will simply turn another method of officials to stronghand the honest business and extort money if there is no proper oversight on antiprofiteering body cvc in railway was established to catch corrupt officials it is yet to catch a single official and we know how much corruption is there this will lead to more govt  more govt means more corruption and inefficiency i think it will take atleast 23 years to have clarity on rates and various legal issues till then  there would be chaos and inflation will generally increase after that  if govt make right iterations  we might see the benefit of gst lastly  in india reforms generally work in different way govt takes 3 steps ahead and after much brouhaha it takes the two steps back so  you are left with only one step in right direction which is better than zero steps ahead,Responsbile_Indian, i actually welcome the one nation  one tax system but with gst  this primary objective is defeated when we have multiple tax rates but there is hope the rates will be made homogeneous over a period of timegst is taunted  as a measure to reduce the paper work and complexity of businesses but the government failed to address where we the consumers are in the equation it was advocated that the less procedures and simplicity in tax returns would increase the efficiency and would result in reduction of cost which will ultimately benefit the consumershowever  with the raise of key services like banking  insurance  etc from the existing 15 service tax to 18 gst  the consumer interest takes back seat for service industry i believe they should have atleast kept in a similar rates since there is no visible benefit when you are going to higher tax for the same shitty servicesthe governments preparedness with systems is questionable since there were reports that the implementation dates should be postponed due to this but the government is firm on implementing from july 1st  as with demonetization they are not bothered with the consequences but this will ultimately affect the businesses and result in lower growthas you mentioned  registration with multiple states and filing returns would defeat the primary purpose of gst also for interstate transactions  the government advised the business to continue using the existing forms  so the state border checkposts will remainyes in longer run probably 3  5 years the system will mature and we may even have one single rate for all commodities in the future  to tell you the truth op i still dont understand what the gst does  i mean i get the gist of it like all indirect taxes will be abolished   different tax rates by different states will now be the same but other than it i still dont know what it is going to do i think a lot of us cheered its passage  but in hindsight  i really think the bjp should have waited until securing its own majority in the rajya sabha instead as you  op  point out  they ended up having to make too many mini concessions to get everyone on board  and the effect was just replacing 28 different complicated  bureaucratic af tax systems to one big one but its a step in the right direction in hindsight a lot of modi bhakts  myself included  naively supposed this was going to be a quick shot  overnight process  i think successive governments will keep tweaking it hopefully why would inflation rise?  deleted ,2017-06-23 22:02:19

i find northies cool i just dont understand why they dont wear lungi i had a big rant but after reading what i had written i think its better i dont post it   i realize that i havent interacted on a personal level with any north indian before to make any kind of callbut an interesting incident happened to my parents they had gone to punjab  forget which city  and asked around for a place to stay immediately the sikh maama invited my parents to stay in their home more like forcefully insisted my parents were really touched except for one niggle apparently the family had this little servantgirl they constantly shouted at people in tn at least are very vocal about their rights and the servants here brook no disrespect my parents  on returning to chennai  sent the punjabi family a kancheepuram silk dress jerks gonna be jerks  there aint no northsouth divide for that  i was once driving in himachal and was overtaking on a single lane road a guy hanging from a tempo coming from opposite side yelled  delhi vall hai delhi valla  apparently he could pick up where i was from  even thought i was driving a car with himachal no plate  just buy watching my driving style  which i am not now very proud of now  i figure highly insulated inbred northie or southie tend to run into issues some exposure and mental acceptance makes either much better to be around that said  you are more likely to meet an insular northie  than corresponding southie simply due to force of numbers  weekly parathabutter chicken vs idlysambhar threadweekly big b vs thalaiva thread i am north indian  who has many south indian friends i have many other friends from various parts of the country  mainly because i lived in a hostel  which had people from all over the country while i know  many north indians  tend to have some stereotypical image of south indians  and vice versa  i for one  always avoided acting on any such impulses  and tried my best treating everyone  for who they are but boy  i was wrong i dont want to be diplomatic here  but really  south indians hate north indians they dont even want to make an effort to move out and socialise with people from other places language is a barrier  but i can cut them some slack there  because they say they are most comfortable in their own languages but really  in my current group  i am the only north indian  with a group of kannada people and they cant stop trying to put me down  at any instance possible this is not a unique experience they are unobjective  and they think their values are the ones that should be abided by everyone else they refuse to make a slightest change in their understanding in trying to understand a different personthe only south indian good friends that i have  are the ones  who for the most part  havent lived there i know you can say the same about north indians as well but well  i am just ranting about my experience here  well  i cant figure out why there are almost no northie guys getting roles as heroes but almost every other heroines are of northern origin in southern movies why?

Non-Political,the head of department of my college just confessed that our final exams are evaluated randomly  and in less than 2 minutes per answer sheet how can we get this to some news outlet?nonpolitical,41,4js5cx,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4js5cx/the_head_of_department_of_my_college_just/,17,im posting this the third time because  r india doesnt allow quora links you can find the source by copy pasting some text from below and googling i am going to write the truth about this unfair evaluationthere are few things u must know  1 ggsipu pays rs 25 per answer book in one bundle there are 30 answer books so it makes rs750   for evaluating one bundleggsipu norms say that a evaluator must take 3 hours to evaluate one bundleso in a day a evaluator can evaluate a maximum of two bundleswhich makes a total earning of rs1500  per day + a conveance of rs600  per day making the total amount  rs 2100  now what actually happens is in the university there are two evaluation centres one for first and third year and the other for second and final yearnow actually what happens isan evaluator reaches centre a at 930 am and get a bundle issued which he she checks in one hour but do not deposit it as the university employees will not take it back before three hoursso they leave that bundle there and rush too the b centre and get another bundle issued there at 1100  they check it by 1200 now they rush back to centre a to return their previous bundle and get a new bundle issued therethe same process is repeated and an evaluator ends up in checking two bundles each at both evaluation centres thus earning rs 4200  a day instead of rs 2100   a day now just imagine the answer book u wrote in 3 hours is evaluated in less then 2 minutescoz the evaluator has to right the marks on front sheet and do the total and also fill an additional evaluation sheet with marksand all this he does in a maximum of 1 and a half hour for 30 answer books this is done by around 20  evaluators who comes for evaluation  2 to be an evaluator the university ask every evaluator to fill a form which contains a maximum of four subject that the evaluator has taught in the current semesterthis form need to be signed by the hod and the head of the institution alsonow the beauty is very few teachers teaches more then two subject in college but in these forms most of the evaluators fill four subjectsnow imagine four subject for centre a and four subject for centre b which mean they know 8 subjects and thus makes them elligible to check copies of 8 different subjectscoz if one subject answer books are over then they can get the next subject issued  3 approx 80  of the evaluators do not prepare a solution nor do they know the solutionthey are just giving average marksthat is the reason why the students writing anything get marks and often pass the exams  4 most of the senior and sincere teachers do not go for evaluationthe people doing evaluation are primarily those who are on consolidated salary getting anything between rs20 000  to rs 30 000  as salary from there parent collegeso they find it as an opportunity to earn some extra moneyjust imagine that there are evaluators who earn around rs 50 000  or even more during evaluationthis should explain most of the reasons  5 the fact is very few evaluators actually evaluate the answer books90 of evaluation is done with just the monitary benefits associated with itso until the university takes some serious counter measures this will continue to happen  i am sorry for those who feel offended by my answerbut am ready to face any debate who could challenge my answer  mukesh sahu assistant professor  ece deptt  hod  industry institute partnership cell  branch counsellor ieeegtbit guru tegh bahadur institute of technology g8 area  rajouri garden   new delhi,fuckGGSIPU, you cannot do anything dude thats the way copies are checked all over india trust me happens here to   university of madras and anna universityanna university is the worst of the lot  i have seen my friends getting a s grade after applying for revaluationin the end they pay 750rs per paper original exam fese  + 700rs revaluation fess  any inside stories from vtu? eh? isnt this common knowledge? in ap  telangana both 10th 11th and 12th papers are corrected by lecturers coming from schools and other districts and they are paid according to number of answer scripts they check like 8rs per paper so  to make money  they end up rushing even ou and jntu engineering papers are corrected this way also  since they come from other districts  if you give latest relevant examples on your answers  theyll cut marks since that example is different from your text book subjective exams in india   ah the good old days in my medical sciences university  we enacted wide ranging examination reforms we tried to make all our examinations objective  see osce   ospe   however  the medical council of india had mandated essay and short answer type questions and we could only impose objectivised examinations for the formative stage for summative however  we did thisone evaluator will evaluate one answer for all the students who appeared in the exam his bias will be distributed equally to all the students also  we do postexamination analysis to see if the answermarks form a bell curve camel humps and shifts to right and left will make us blacklist the examiner in post graduate exams  the same answersheet is evaluated independently by three examiners  blinded to others marks if the discrepancy between the three is greater than 25  a fourth examiner is bought in and the average of all the four is taken as marks awardedit is possible to study the problem and introduce corrective steps  but most of our universities are archaic and very slow to change anything  it happened to me in my first semester at college of engineering guindy  chennai   the lecturer was miffed with our batch and decided to fail random students   she awarded f for first  middle and last 6 of students with even roll numbers     i fell in one of those even roll number and failed  despite having scored s grade in all my internals  and it was my favourite paper   failing first time academically was hard on me  and i was crying in my lecture hall for the whole day  cringe    i had to apply for reevaluation to clear it      that episode was a turning point in my student life  and went on to score few more arrears in the following semesters  and didnt give a flying fuck        our rating systems are a joke being an ex  ipu student im not even surprised  happened to me in 12th boardused to always score 90+ in maths  was expecting atlesst 95 got 40applied for revaluation nothing happened ,2016-05-18 07:14:50

from reading about india on reddit and elsewhere  ive heard the culture is very chauvinistic  and that women shouldnt walk alone at night  and that generally woman are off limits in most cases ive heard this from both nonindians and indians and also heard that relationships between men and woman are usually arranged by their parents  and i think gandhi practiced this  though i dont think its common practice today   and so maybe this is why there are no acceptable ways of approaching femalesim not trying to be offensive and i dont mean to sound ignorant  but i feel like this is the only way to really gather acceptable cultural practices  through wordofmouth and anecdotal  folk experiences im only asking whats an acceptable way of approaching  as in starting a conversation  with an indian female  that could possibly be romantic in nature  i hate saying this   but without any possibility of coming of as offensive  or as harassment  or in anyway seeming as negative in intentions,alphonse23, just be normal in that sense  our urban culture is westernised people date like westerners do so there is not much difference in the way you should approach her obviously  dont crack jokes like cows on roads in india and things  its just not nice send her an emaildear rashmi i have been noticing you everyday throwing away perfectly good styrofoam cups in the bin as these are nonbiodegradable and costly cups  i feel it is very wasteful to throw them away after just onetime use i have been collecting all the cups you threw away on a daily basis and i am using them myself to reduce the environmental impact how about we start sharing our styrofoam cups everyday from here onwards will save me the trouble of keeping an eye on you and diving into the bin to retrieve your cup   this will definitely save the company a lot of money in the long run and it makes everything i drink taste sweeter   we can talk to the ceo about importing kulhads from your exotic native land and share  one kulhad per team this would surely increase the team spirit and harmony among all of us i invite you for sharing a cup of coffee  if you want  today evening in the cafeteria  awaiting your reply alphonse23 qhow to approach an indian girl?awith caution ask her question about  ddlj  http  wwwimdbcom title tt0112870   read this http  wwwquoracom indianwomen whyisitdifficulttodateanindiangirlingeneral answers 2126033?sridiqbwshare1ask yourself if you really want to go through the trouble try this line i am pretty  you are pretty  lets go home and stare at each other indian girls like agressive men so  next time you see her in the break room throwing away a precious styrofoam cup in waste  you pick up the cup from the bin and shove it down her goddamn mouth she does this really unusual thing where she goes to the break room  drinks water from a new cup  then throws it into the trash  somewhat dramatically   wasting a perfectly clean styrofoam cup thats only had water in it  which i consider very wasteful  its a styrofoam cup and its nonbiodegradable  it seems a little unusual  but im not sure  it could be normal behavior where she comes fromin india its traditionally considered unclean to eat drink from someone else plate cupso while she might find it wasteful too  she may be doing so because of her upbringing or in order to not offend others who she thinks feel that way smear yourself with chocolate syrup and ice creamput a strawberry garland around your dick and a marigold garland around your neckgoto office like this magical things will happen  here you go  http  wwwyoutubecom watch?vxngnluelva  dont do it you dont want to get slapped  humiliated and labelled a sexual predator in your office  do you? approach her father next time you see her around  strike up a conversation about a shared experience something bland and officerelated so as to be unthreatening a coworkers birthday  how you had to park so far from the entrance  the rude security guard  that new guy in hr  whatever you can guage if she keeps her interactions more guarded  or if shes a little more open with people  based on that  you could move on to asking her out in a way that wont be weird as for the new styrofoam cup  there is a concept of echhal in south india  jesus  i never thought id spell that out in english   im sure north indians have an equivalent its basically that it is considered dirty to use utensils or consume food water that have already had someone elses spit on them  this becomes much more relaxed  of course  when its someone youre close with  so  not saying that her cupthrowing activities are spot on  just that that may be where its coming from maybe you could talk to her about bringing her own reuseable bottle in or once you get to a loveydovey stge  buy her one d  host a party and invite her to it?  ask her out for a coffee  she will get it  okay  you want to talk to her because she is dramatically wasting perfectly clean styrofoam cups  or is it for your amorous overtures? is her cabin anywhere near yours? if yes  act like youreally watching cricket on your computer screen when you know she is walking past you even if she doesnt like cricket  it will definitely pique her interest dont trust indian girls living abroad they will whore themselves out just to get a shot at living in the states this is generally true but dont take it as gospelapproach her as you would any other girl  indian girls are the same  they behave differently only coz life for a female in india is tough  but be very wary if things go well and you start dating and shit  do try to know her extremely well indian girls are either extremely money minded or extremely simple an indian girl who is not money minded shouldnt be let go they will never let go of you in dire sickness also https  wwwyoutubecom watch?vg0gnshiyhfe its a tech company right? get to know what technology shes working on  ask her help on this most girls ive known have a patronising tendency  in any case take it slow instead of asking her  make her ask u  as u interact more often  ask her to take u to an indian movie  ask her to bring indian food for u  ask her to invite u home to learn how to cook indian food  if its a big city there would surely be indian festivalcelebrations such as holi  diwali  navratri  ganesha puja  id  christmas  ask her to take u along if she thinks that others are seeing the two of u hanging together often enough  itll fall into place effortlessly of course when the two of u are comfortably friendly u can ask her out  just ensure she remains comfortable best of luck do have an indian wedding if things really hit off betweenthe two of u  else make sure u share the happiness in gonewild  rape her,2014-02-08 11:31:58

 well documented reality of our times that work balance life is highly trash in indiawork environments are largely toxic too due to a culmination of many internal  external factorsthe commute eats into a substantial time of the day for most folks as well on top of this are there any organizations in india who have already implemented a 4 day week  or are such plans in the pipeline for companies?what are your thoughts on such an initiative  does anyone reckon it will succeed here?,PuneriPerson, the single biggest minus point about indian society is the nonexistence of clear communication and lack of transparency and accountability in dealing with things  such being the case  the 4 hour workday wont work because that kind of productivity requires an enormous amount of clarity with the undestanding that the everyone involved is working hard to get the job done japan and india are two entirely different animalsjapan has an ageing workforce it also has a work environment that emphasises employees working long hours the stress had in recent times resulted in multiple news reports of employees committing suicide which had prompted a national outcry and condemnationin addition to this  the worknolife balance also resulted in men and women choosing to marry late or choosing to delay having children this isnt good considering the already low population growth rate in the country this has even led to the mechanisation of many low end jobs in japan because they cant find enough people to workso a 4 day work week might work in a country like japan which is carrying out iniatives in order to promote population growth the 4 day work week has a high synergy with these objectivesindia meanwhile has a high population growth  high unemployment and a young workforce the competition here has prompted firms to cut costs in order to maintain profit this often means a smaller workforce  which still does the same amount of work by taking longer hours  but without any commiserate increase in remuneration even when an employee is burned out  the rat race in india is so bad that there is always an enormous pool of often unemployed underemployed applicants who are ready to be hired at short notice for a lower pay so the employers can simply choose to fire the burned out employees and hire new recruits to keep the assembly line at worklong story short in japan  employees are still a key human resource in india  they are an expendable tool many times we have to work on weekends anyways cant think why that will change and it wont matter

yourself the government has already decided 6 days a week  9 hours a day for everybody bhai middle managers wont let this happen mandated 5 day work week would be a start apart from mncs and few central government offices  everyone else works on saturdays also what would be the secondary effects of this move  as participation in hobbies  skill growth  lower commute  traffic congestion  shall all have largely stimulating advantages in the overall environment i am fascinated by what the results of such an experiment will be if implemented on a controlled  small scale i think india would better benefit from more workfromhome options for example  come to office twice a week and wfh other days  especially in congested cities like bangalore now even saturday and sunday leave is a problem either you have to work om weekends due to some emergency or they load you with so much work and such deadlines that you end up working on weekend if we deny the manager will say even we went through this or we will be simply released as there will be 1000s ready to work on saturday and sunday talk about negative competition population  s explosion thats like taking 3 steps at a time first jobs need to be 68 hours long 6 days a week generally people are given work from home even on sundays not to mention people work till 8 when they were supposed to be home by 5 or 6pmcreate a happy environment and people will work better  are there any organizations in india who have already implemented a 4 day week  or are such plans in the pipeline for companies?          lol i was recently ghosted by a startup for letting them know i wasnt comfortable with their 6 day a week schedule  monday to saturday  every single week  read on if youre interested  ________________back story i recently interviewed at a startup for a tech role  data scientist  and was going through the final socalled cultural fit interview i have almost 3 years of experience in the field i currently work at a startup that works monday to friday  40 hours a week    just doing my due diligence  i asked the interviewer if they work on saturdays to my disappointment  he said they do now  this was my 5th interview round not once did they tell me about their monsat schedule i only got to know because i asked for some context  this startup is 4 years old  have their product out in the market and have close to 30 employees  their claim  i was never invited to their office and all interviews happened on the phone in the course of a single week    as soon as i heard of their 6 day work schedule  i was disappointed i mean  coming from a startup background myself  i understand the kind of hard work people need to put in every once in a while working on saturdays during emergencies and other critical events is perfectly fine  but every single week? come on oh  and i also would get no equity for my work there  but working on weekends wasnt necessarily a deal breaker to me i just wanted to put myself in their shoes and know why i mentioned to the guy upfront that my current organisation works 5 days a week  and that my life is built around a monfri schedule so it will be difficult to adjust to a 6 day work week    the guy must have realised my disappointment  this was on the phone   and so he started talking about how much potential this company has for growth and how much i could grow with the company anyway  i wanted to ask them their rationale for working every saturday the next time we spoke  and also to evaluate for myself whether sacrificing my social life and hobbies for a job was worth it coincidentally  this conversation happened on a friday  i got a text message the next day  saturday   saying lets close this today i had a long week and i switched off for the next two days and i didnt respond until monday i apologised for the delay  saying that i took some time off for the weekend and was ready for a discussion    that was it i never heard from them again i never said no to working on saturdays  but still they ghosted me i guess they wanted someone who would be submissive and not question their wisdom which is a shame  because the product  from what they told me  seemed interesting  but some of my friends say this was good riddance part of the problem is that our labour regulations and enforcement is  mildly put  absolutely terrible looking at indian labour laws is a crash course in the necessity of updating laws to new circumstances and the need to discard old laws in an expeditious manner rather than just getting by on the courts desperately trying to make the woefully inadequate laws fit the needs of todayeven in sectors with massive deficits of required workers  such as medicine and law   the actual worker holds little power since regulations are lax and theres no one powerful actually standing up for them a doctor or lawyer  especially one thats just starting out  will universally work long hours at the cost of his health  not because hes easily replaced  but because his managers are  for the most part  so inept that it would be tragic if it werent hilarious the iron law of wages is evident here for most to seenow how this can be remedied is a task in and of itself it starts right from said horribly convoluted and loophole riddled regulations to the rather asinine practices of promoting professionals to managerial positions based on their ability to do their original job  a good doctor or lawyer isnt a good manager or leader  and linking payments to said promotions  which forces said professionals to seek such positions for better remuneration and yes  theres more to it than that  but the short answer is that the problem is very much systemic this is as much cultural  if not more so  than it is economic and that wages do not reflect demand or skill  otherwise wed be paying the people who clean gutters more than any corporate ceo or hedge fund manager   they reflect status and power 4 days working  what a joke for indian owners i can see some of my friends are working on saturdays also also  some are happy with their alternative saturday holidays i am sure as the sun that india will never implement this type of formula even government will do  private company owners they will never spend a minute to think about it you talking about 4 days working last month i worked on 2nd october without getting extra pay  its not like im talking about small towns this scene is available in one of the metro city in india and only officially declared heritage city of india   would never work with our work ethic already mondays and fridays half the day is gone in either reaching late after leave travels or leaving early for leave travel i still know people working in 6 days week even i used to work 6 days few years back lets make a uniform 5day work week first better to learn to walk before attempting to run  deleted  most of the work in india is about availability and not about capability   our work culture is a reflection of it   in both public and private sectors     being specific to it companies we are mostly cost centres which do really little productive work hence the moment we go for a 3 day weekend thereby increasing cost   these jobs will be outsourced to a cheaper location also apart from the highly questionable work culture we also suffer from highly questionable work ethic   as employees some treat their job as timepass activity  working as seat warmers for these people a 3 day weekend is pointless3 day weekend boost productivity which is amazing for people involved in demanding profiles  for this strategy to work in india we will need to have jobs that involve rd  planning or designing   the problem is this kind of work demands attention and critical thinking  something our newer generation is quite not trained due to being spoon fed in schools with meaningless grades and ignored by professors in higher studies  hence the 2nd thing will be reform our education system which emphasises more on thinking and less on following it will work only if the office remains open six or seven days a week and there are alternate workers for those days which others have offthat will kill both the unemployment problem and improve worker productivity might work where creativity is given large portion of importancefor labour   essential services like hospital   it wont work   as this will hamper production in case of industries   and routine work procedure in case of health care industry,2019-11-04 16:57:24

Scheduled,i am from shaheen bagh and i hope the protest here ends,30,fahqeu,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fahqeu/i_am_from_shaheen_bagh_and_i_hope_the_protest/,15,i remember the day of violence at jamia university i had just come from office and one of my friend who was in the rally that had tried marching towards parliament and as soon as it had reached mathura road  a major road in delhi  the rally faced an unexpected amount of force from police  a violent lathicharge he said  people ran in all directions and cops chased them all over next thing he sees is buses burning  police firing gun on protestors all i said to him is   i wish people didnt protest because this will not yield anything  he didnt believe me so  i switched on my tv and showed him the narrative that was spun on the incident by media he was shocked next day shaheen bagh protest started and rest is history but never once did i think from day one that bjp will talk or courts will intervene and never believed that this was a good idea as shaheen bagh road is major thoroughfare between noida   delhi  faridabad and gurgaon and hence it will only make more haters because i know most people dont really care what the indian muslim thinks it has all come true  and today as more than ever  i wish this protest ended i was brought up in india and never did i consider this country to be more than a hindu nation  with muslims living in their aukaat i grew up watching mahabharata  ramayana and om namah shivay on government owned national television  visited government offices with temples and other unlimited signs of hinduism in government that established that as you grew older  met kids who had never met a muslim and knew zilch about islam but could tell you 100s of stereotypes about muslims as facts countless incidents made an imprint on you and you learnt to keep your head down and just live in your ghetto but now my ghetto  which is chose for security over facilities is gone but the thing is  i had learnt to live with that but this protest makes me feel unsafe i feel noticed i dont want that till this protest   nobody knew what was shaheen bagh  i liked that now i feel exposed and worried that i might have crossed my aukaat and will soon feel the punishment for it so please my friends at the protest  please stop itps just my rant  thought  dont downvote because you dont agree  kindly comment or else move onedit  i also do not want the protest to end you have to understand that as a muslim in india  i am used to keeping my head down and going on with life but this  this is totally new this is a revolt of a sort  which totally makes lots of people among us nervous  we get these thoughts and i just articulated it here thank you all for the support and understanding,zafar_bull, well if the protest ends here then its a amit shah victory he got a new template dangay karao protest khatam and you will see that applied all over india if someone is protesting peacefully against injustice they have every right i understand and empathize with your perspective however  if you want the protest to end  that means you are okay with giving up the only resistance there exists against the caa without the protests  and essentially no one being outraged   the act gets implemented silently and obediently  and you are at the mercy of this genocidal government you are okay with atrocities being committed against people of your religion and possibly you yourself there is literally no other fight available to people right now other than peaceful protesting  even if it may eventually lead to nothing at least it keeps international media attention on india and possibly reduces the damage inflicted on muslims or postpones it unless you have a better alternative than protestingif you are okay with protesting  but not in shaheen bagh because it makes your life more difficult  and would rather that the protests moved elsewhere in a different locality  your argument is selfish  albeit valid  but undoubtedly selfish and theres no merit in that for me  sorry you would rather that someone else gets inconvenienced and threatened  and while of course that may be a natural reaction  it is not very endearing no  op do you think that if all protests end   the hatred will stop? no do you know what bjps no 1 weapon is? it is hate hate will always exist in peoples hearts unless these hindutva goons sitting in the centre are thrown we need everyone in our country to realise that hateful hyper nationalism is very bad oppression is very bad and it is only achievable through protests times are hard now but trust me when i say that this protest is the only reason people have hope right now they already had the chronology planned they always had the plan to attack the minorities we all know what they wanted but the protest made a revolt against them and people not only from minorities but also the majority of hindus started joining this protest is not between hindu and muslims its a protest of the educated vs the oppressor they want you to go weak and they will land the first blow but they cant take away the hope and the unity of the people because religion comes after humanity you can be a muslim or a hindu but firstly were an indian and we learnt to respect all the religions i understand your opinion and perspective but i have a question for you would you also advice women in your house to cooperate with the rapist to reduce the pain in case someone attacks them? weve seen similar events play out in indian history multiple times but just taking events which have been done by the duo at the helm of the country right now if gujarat is any indication  there might be pogroms in the future for muslims followed by segregated housing  similar to ahmedabad  if assam is any indication  the nrc process will be brutal  imprecise and disproportionately affect poor people if the kashmiri pandit exodus genocide is any indication  the  current  ruling party is willing to just keep using some token crowd as a political prop to suit its agenda without actually doing anything for them if modern kashmir is any indication  the government is willing cut off basic necessities  eg internet  for months just to enforce their police state  jail people without reason etc if the demonetization is any indication  the government is willing to put its own citizens at huge risk just to win an election  up election  and on the basis of some tinpot economicsif you look at other events in indian history  sikh riots  kashmiri pandit exodus  mumbai riots of 1993  1983 nellie massacre  we can see the patterns emerge here as wellweve seen such events play out elsewhere in the world too india is not unique in this respectthe nrccaa process preceded by a pogrom? your documents will burn in your houses and then youll be forced to somehow produce those documents to prove your citizenship itll leave a lot of casualties  and now only the nonmuslims will get citizenship back through caa you go to a detention campthis is an existential crisis for muslims so im not surprised that they are taking to the streetslets not forget this first they came for the socialists  and i did not speak out         because i was not a socialist then they came for the trade unionists  and i did not speak out because i was not a trade unionist then they came for the jews  and i did not speak out         because i was not a jew then they came for meand there was no one left to speak for me martin niemoller you have put into words what i have been feeling for the longest time this doesnt mean im in favour of ending the protest it is a thought at the back of your mind that still recalls the old days and i think thats what op wants to say also brother i heard shaheen bag at this moment is a power outage and very tense situation for all please god let peace prevail when does it become ok to block the roads?,2020-02-28 09:19:44

a look at castewise food preferences could provide some insights as is common knowledge  the ranking of castes is mostly influenced by purity of occupation and diet in castesociety  to achieve purity of body and spirit  it is necessary to be a vegetarian and religious simultaneously  something best embodied by a brahminthe percentage of nonvegetarians among scheduled castes and scheduled tribes  both for men and women  is much higher than among those who are not from these communities and in the latter group  the highest incidence of vegetarianism is found among brahmins at almost over 50 the higher the caste  the greater the possibility of them being pure vegetariansthe burden of dietpurity and vegetarianism is  however  more on women than menbroadly  presentday vegetarianism in india constitutes a form of moral power of minority within hindus  with such a power being forced on the nonvegetarian majority  with their consent this new sociality is a sign of progress in modern caste belief where the seductive power of vegetarianism and its associated purity travels seamlessly across bodies and spaces without dissenthow fragile must the morals of the vegetarian castes be if they feel threatened by the introduction of eggs for poor children in schools? the morals of indian vegetarians continue to be based less on compassion for humans and animals  and more driven by ideas of hierarchy and purity in this scheme of hierarchy  one who eats beef is placed at the lowest rung like humans of caste  not all animals carry equal sympathy there exists some hierarchy where the cow  indigenous  not jersey  takes the highest sacral form compared to the rest gandhi improvised his vegetarianism through inflicting violence and control on the self presentday castesubjects and their vegetarianism  however  thrive on violence  both on the self and others the state across india through various governments has mostly been party to this process  promoting the hegemony of misguided vegetarianism,VelvetHedgehog, people in the northeast do not seem to have any dietary restrictions https  myoutubecom watch?vglzukz1fuqghowever  the problem arises when bigots and racists use this to demonstrate their nonindianess for in their logic such people could only be chinese if you want to see how caste affects the perception of nonvegetarianism look no further than tamil nadu the majority of the state is nonvegetarian it has an incredibly developed nonvegetarian cuisine ask anyone outside the south about the perception of tamilians and its always vegetarian majority of the reason is because outside the state the vast majority of tamilians working are brahmins  especially in civil service   and most of the eateries outside the state are run by brahmins for those that dont know  this is dalit cuisinehttps  wwwgooglecouk amp s homegrowncoin amp article 803216 dalitidentityandfoodmemoriesoftraumaonaplatehttps  populacom 2018 11 20 thereisnodalitcuisine https  wwwgooglecouk amp s wwwlivemintcom leisure wjzdhgee4csax2bjhjhmsl astoryofculinaryapartheidhtml3ffacetampwould you eat this? perhaps if you were starving and nothing else was available to you? that is why these people started eating them  removed  im not telling everyone to eat nonveg  beef or pork i know the last two are unfathomable for most of us however  those that want to eat them should have no restrictions there never used to be any such laws before and this was the traditional diet of many communities gai doodh nahi deti hai  hum usse le lete hai spot on its not like we are an animal or natureloving society otherwise its all caste  masquerading as lifestyle choices i belong to small backwards village in up where we didnt have electricity until a few years agooutside our village was a basti of the chamarsthey certainly did not eat lithi chokha unless it was given to them as leftovers all they were entitled to eat was the leftovers of higher castes and they used to take the joothan of both hindus and muslims without discrimination i am haunted by a moment when i was around 10 years old and ran after the ice cream cycle and bought an ice cream and i was greedily eating it like a pig while a boy the same age as me but from the chamar community was staring at the ice cream and at me and i still remember the look on his fathers face his father wanted to buy one for his son as well and went after the ice cream man my mother told me to eat it away from them so that they cannot see and najar nahi lagegi they ate pig and breed them and would sacrifice a pig every year to their caste god they also ate the flesh of all dead animals they ate lizards  jackals  mongoose i dont get the cow fascination most cows are domesticated so they grow up for sole purpose of feeding milk to the population so why get offended when people eat it i mean the cow served same purpose in both cases to feed people  i will never get the cow thing its so stupid my great grandfather brahmin  moved to west bengal and since then most of our family members are non vegetarians but still beef is very sensitive topic i hope someday we can see through this bs its a domesticated animal people stop getting offended i am sorry but you are using the words indian and caste very vaguely i am an upper caste brahmin from the bengal originally and there is no such restriction for any caste in fact even the pujari eats non veg after doing puja  in fact he is fed before everyone else can eat also  same is the case in kashmiri shaivism and a lot of other tantric sects as well it is only a few elitist brahmins  mostly vaishnavites  who promote such ideas and should be looked down upon because they spoil the name of hinduism we are a very vast culture with many schools of thought we cant demean hinduism entirely just because a part of it is very casteist we need to learn  rewrite and renarrate hinduism to the massesthere is a lot of hindutva propaganda but lets try to see though it and not kill beef eaters or look down upon meat eaters ps i did upvote because you started a great convo here we need more and more diverse voices just like everything else in india such hypocrisy is ripe in india and i personally feel there is a need for drastic change that would make the society casteless and classless may be im wrong but its time for a change in mindset of people of course most people in this country dont actually care about animals we all see and ignore the plight of street animals every single day by that argument are jains and bhuddists also forcing vegetarianism ? or is it only the brahmins who are espousing vegetarianism on everyone kshatriyas were warriors and kings they ate meat so to say vegetarianism has to do a lot with casteism is being a bit dishonest indian cuisine is one of the few which organically has so much vegetarian food choices instead of just meat substitutes it is sad that even that is used to fuel hatred on this sub hope you find peace op what is this? bootleg scroll article? this write up is sprinkled with gems like broadly  presentday vegetarianism in india constitutes a form of moral power of minority within hindus  with such a power being forced on the nonvegetarian majority  with their consentda fuqanother gem the burden of dietpurity and vegetarianism is  however  more on women than menhmm what?? why is this nonsense just there right in the middle without any preface and conclusion?and wonderful theorem proving techniques to prove vegetarianism in india has more to do with caste hierarchy than love for animalsgoes on to assume the same thing the morals of indian vegetarians continue to be based less on compassion for humans and animals  and more driven by ideas of hierarchy and purityproof assume theorem is true  theorem is true now done#x200b there are many things wrong with caste  but vegetarianism isnt one of them so vegetarianism is bad because of brahmins? i feel nowadays caste based vegetarianism is like forced practice i have friends who belong to the swami caste yet they eat meat and stuff outside in secret and practice vegetarianism at home this is pure bs  people are non vegetarian because that comes naturally to them and easily accessible in todays world we dont even need to rely on meat as we can get majority of required supplements with veg counterparts and remaining can be found in eggs most baniyas vaishyas are vegetarian kshatriyas have a high percentage of meat eaters any ism is more about moral superiority than the real thing absolutely were a hypocritical bunch with dung for brains if we had the sense to look beyond brahmin india  wed see how people thrive with nonvegetarian food in their diets its beyond cringe to see our athletes against say  australian or new zealand athletes,2020-01-14 18:25:50

thanks for the detailed selfpost nri bhakts to boycott seattle and microsoft now this is great news after the eu hope the sc would atleast think twice now before giving blow job to the modi govt omg  the beeline of whatsapp university graduates sharing their whatsapp gyan with the council members is patheticit is almost like they were forced outside of their zee news whatsapp bubble but never realized it and kept repeating their whatsapp chants thank you for the summary op were they chanting nm zindabad as they left the hall? utterly despicable well done  seattle council and well done all those who worked so hard to create and table this resolution so uh  will the international pressure help? what if they become even more authoritarian? thanks op for the video link and tldw this was a good watch wish we had neutral courtrooms here also  im sad to see how propoganda has consumed highly educated folks all over the globe if over they open their ears and minds to the other side of the story these sanghi bhakts are the same everywhere innit spew lies  shout  disrupt and then blame everyone else apart from themselves good job for chronicling all this  op with bhakts  its painfully evident that while they feel greatly for the persecuted minorities  their hatred for muslims is much more in magnitude a bhakt who is truly for the persecuted hindu minority would have suggested inclusion of all religions so that relief for persecuted hindus is expedited in the light of the protests of course bjps doesnt give two shits about the persecuted hindus their endgame is mostly wb polls where they stand to immensely gain if the muslim illegals are disenfranchised   who currently are part of the mamta vote bank  un should pass a resolution against caa nrc impose sanctions  if required whatever it takes  the spirit of india must be saved nice to see the council focused on the real issues of the city always wondered why shit never got done in seattle thanks hasnt us  france and israel supported caa or my facebook feed is broken? again this only highlights biggest red flag with muslims  there i said it  bury me  that religion  nation why are they talking about india in seattle they are just hacking the democratic processes and have misplaced loyalties i want to see one passed against china bunch of hypocrites its like saying happy mahoram to a muslim it is insulting  unrelated  how can mahoram be happy?

were made without my consent  there was no attempt to get me to rewrite  my column or change its arguments until this week  when the hindustan times declined to print the column i had sent  which was scheduled to appear on sunday  april 19 i am grateful to the wire for carrying this column in its entirety in a twopart article published last month in the website newslaundry  the writer alpana kishore subjected the project to redesign new delhis central vista to critical scrutiny the  first part  https  wwwnewslaundrycom 2020 03 16 pmshouseonrajpathhowasupereliteiscapturingdelhisland   asked the question why is redeveloping central vista a bigger  priority than fixing the capitals catastrophic air pollution or  plummeting life expectancy?in answering this question  kishore focused on one key element in the  project the provision for a grand new house for the prime minister  on  rajpath such selfindulgence  she argued  may be common in  dictatorships  but was inappropriate for a republic if one thinks of  delhi as akin to london or berlin  a capital of a democracy  then  argues kishore  spending hundreds of crores on a second house for the prime minister ahead  of fixing delhis pressing problems like its catastrophic air pollution  which causes 80 deaths per day and 45 percent of all premature deaths  is a spectacularly insensitive move that puts a powerful elite firmly  above the peoples good on the other hand  if we are in the  beijingpyongyangmoscow axis where citizens are passive spectators  it  is absolutely normalthe  second part  https  wwwnewslaundrycom 2020 03 17 gujaratmodel20thesuperelitesmagicwandtotakeoverpublicspace   of kishores article focused on the process by which the project was  awarded a process marked by secrecy and subterfuge  ending in the  contract going to a firm of architects from gujarat known to be  particularly close to the prime minister this firms previous projects   wrote kishore  had depended for their execution upon the removal of  obstacles like due process  impact assessments  public consultation   and wellestablished global best practices the firms past record  in  sum  was one of consistently manifesting an innate disrespect for the  citizenin concluding her twopart essay  kishore remarkedthe biggest irony remains that a prime  minister from the humblest of backgrounds should yearn for a house on  rajpath  no less  to endorse his vision of personal greatness and  legacy would emmanuel macron demand and  more importantly  get  a house on the champs elyses? can even trump

concerns entirely this project has been pushed through without wider  consultation with the public  or even with domain experts in  architecture and urban planningin fact  as one who has seen the work

campus for the indian institute of ahmedabad  the original iima campus  designed by louis kahn  beautifully blends  traditional and modern practices  using red brick  open windows  and  courtyards it is a joy to see  walk through  study and teach in its  successor is cold and soulless  built entirely of concrete  those  assigned offices there yearn for a transfer to the original and much  more

justification of the project is that it was  to mark not a personal but a national milestone  the 75th anniversary  of indian independence this is disingenuous  because past anniversaries  overseen by

i tell her i dont care and neither do my parents then i tell her about my caste  and she starts acting weird starts replying to my texts in syllables and tries to hang up on my calls i feel bad and message her asking what ticked her off she says that she thought i was from an upper caste and thats why she replied to my message and now she doesnt want to proceed any further and want to cancel all further plans i told her that its a bit hypocritical of her that initially she was one wanting my parents to be ok with her being obc when she thought i was from oc 3  marathi auntie this ones a bit hilarious she sends me a message saying she really liked my profile for her daughter i look it up and sure enough  mentioned any caste i give her my number and she sends me a complete biodata about her daughter daughter is really pretty and from mdi gurgaon  i think great but she mentions caste as rigvedi brahmin i think oh fk i send her all the details  mention my caste and even bracket it with  sc  immediately she goes  i really like your profile tell me the next steps or give me your parents number im like  this cant be happening then it hits me that maybe she has glanced over the caste part in her hurry so i send another text saying  maam pls confirm that you have seen my caste  and it falls under scheduled caste never heard back from herthere are a few more like this most of the profiles message me about my caste and go silent when i mention it i realized that all my life  my circle of friends have ranged from all castes  religions and financial backgrounds and they never made me feel like a dalit or whatever i have lived a happy and fairly successful life that was the reason i was ignoring the caste aspect for finding someone to spend my life now i have learnt my lesson and changed my caste to clearly say sc and will stick to my own i guess i also feel like giving up on these matrimony websites its been a great learning experience about my position in the society folks  ,whiteobsidian, youre actually saving yourself from getting into a family of hypocrites not really a fuck upgood luck i thought caste no longer existed in cities  sfunny how the obc girl was openminded for the castes above her  op  just invite me to your wedding  thats all i care aboutps im from okayish caste  not too high  not too low any caste generally means that they are okay with people of higher caste contacting them  so open minded is my caste plus caste considered above mine matrimonial sites are hilarious and sad just a thought  you are still 27 why hurry?  there was a gilded comment by a black guy a few days ago that said that he really appreciated when the bullets dogdged him for a change  this is the same  unfortunately indian matrimonial sites is just online aunty network without the aunties there will be the same bs except its online take some time out and start dating in the grand scheme of things  finding the right person is as important as jee  any caste means any equal or higher casteeducated modern broadminded indian _hypocrites_op  you dodged a bullet with every one of thosemarry a girl who  as they say  loves you at your worst you are lucky you got matches my friend  bengali upper caste  from iim didnt get any matches when he didnt mention caste in his matrimonial profile 5 years ago this is what modern day untouchability looks like   iim passout working in a well known consulting firm earning about 30lpa sincere  hardworking  simple dudegot 994 ile in cat air in 600s general in iitjeetelugu stops reading iim does not teach you that indians are hypocrites of the first order? sc guy here  top educational institution and worked for top companies but not an iit iim guywhen i got married  the first line of my profile was i am an sc  dont believe in reservation that benefits only the creamy layer rest of the stuff  i was very transparent about what i was looking for  a nononsense girl who is nonhypocrite  non pretentious humanist caste religion no bargot fair number of interests from inside and outside my caste it was hard to see people with matching academic background from an sc caste the nonsc interests i received were mostly from other religionsmarried to a nononsense unpretentious smart girl  her parents are from a brahman + other religion mix a couple of my close friends who married within their caste have said they wished their married life was as stable as mine  after interacting with my wife and me for a whilehang on dude fuck this shit im so tired of people acting all modern on the outside and being a casteist  hater on the inside this is just ridiculous dude hugs man i mean what can i say  just know that if someone asks you your caste theyre not worth your time   removed   deleted   deleted  lesson no 1 those who developed a thinking that girls are some magical creatures and are very innocent and caring should know that they are human and just like men are in general shitty also given the chance they can act even worse than men and they dolesson no 2    caste never goes awaywomen at the time of arranged marriage will prefer someone from their caste only no matter how open minded liberal or progressive they claim to bethe reason for this? all those lables are to fit in socially and nothing elselesson no 3 everyones hypocritical some will admit maximum wont that doesnt change the fact  shaadi ka laddu  ouch some people just suck  op  this is just sadas much as i hate to say this  you should mention your caste on matrimony sites cos ppl do judge you based on caste and this unfortunately is the reality of india better to keep the hypocrites at bay my parents had an intercaste marriage that being said  it is a fact there are differences in upbringing  type of food  type of interests etc  and general attitude mentality of people   pet peeves  biases  dinner convos etc  of families belonging to different castes this isnt that big a deal if the couple plans to stay away from parents and love each other enough to get over the differences in mentality but these differences cause a lot of issues when the couple decides to stay with either set of parents especially for the wife i know my mom suffered a bit in her early days since she is from a lower caste compared to my dad  similar thing happened with one of my aunts my dad stood by my mom and both of them were working and earning so things worked out eventually  my aunt ended up divorcing my unclean upper caste friend of mine married an sc guy and her parents all but abandoned her  her husbands parents were somewhat accepting but issues did creep in over the years and now the couple are staying in a different citymy advice would be to find a girl who is willing to relocate and not overly attached to parents family or someone who has stayed abroad or has had a parent who has worked stayed abroad in those scenarios the caste issue will likely get diluted,2017-12-13 21:16:03
Scheduled,can indians grow a spine already?,281,f2y883,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f2y883/can_indians_grow_a_spine_already/,161,i am so sick of indian men and women being pressured into arranged marriages i am sick of the whole virginity being the sacred bowl of purity  sick of aunties who will keep on nagging you to get married this is absurd everyone puts up the whole  arranged marriages are done with consent bs are they though? deep inside everyone knows that the majority of the indian population is pressured into marriage lets see  if someone pressures you to have sex  it is sexual assault  right? it is a crime you shouldnt be pressured into anything  not even marriage i cant believe how manipulative parents can get  i will slit my wrists if you dont get married  you will see my dead face if you dont get married heres the thing  taking your own life needs a lot of courage  trust me  i have tried your parents wont take their own lives for this you are an adult  probably earning  you can take care of yourself and take your own decisions please dont be pressured and ruin two lives  hell maybe 3 lives  if we assume that you will have a child i am from a dysfunctional family  arranged marriage  of course  and my life has been hell i remember wishing that my parents never got married  even if it resulted in me not being in this world heres the thing  lifes already complicated  you need to earn  do your job  take care of yourself and others  etc  why make life more difficult with things that dont need to be complicated socialize  date  make friends  find common interests  know each other for years  marry thats how biology of the body is some say that arranged marriages have a courtship period  but how long does it last? the maximum amount of time i have seen someone just being engaged in an arranged marriage is 1 year not to mention  the courtships can be in an controlled environment and fixed meeting and schedules how can you be sure your partner wants to marry? hell  how can you be sure? is it because this is just the next step? what if your sexual libidos  kinks dont match? i  for a fact know that i wont marry someone until i have know them for atleast 3 years its sad to see where the society is going you can say that thats how the culture of india is  but does the culture have any value if it suppresses and unnaturalizes the whole concept of love and relationships  the way biology works? if it affects mental health? after all  isnt culture just manmade? only the positive aspects of culture should be kept relationships  sex  love are natural nothing sacred if you want arrange marriage  good for you  just make sure your partner has actually consentedsincerely  a rant by me seeing my dear best friend in depression after being emotionally blackmailed into a marriage with same threats of suicide  log kya kahenge  etc has been terrible know that parents are not gods  they are humans whom you should definitely respect but they do make mistakes even if love marriage doesnt work  you have yourself to blame  not your parents and part in your own terms if you are pressured into a marriage  how can you say that you wont be pressured to no divorce? stand up for yourselfedit this is amusing i would like to point out few things 1  i am not claiming that all arranged marriages are forced i have just stated how forced marriages do happen some people have taken it personally  i just feel it is projection2  many people are denying this  but it happens a lot to the point that it is so normalized that you dont feel it this is not a village thing the friend i mentioned is from mumbai3  the i am a virgin  i want a virgin okay  good for you  its just  i feel that you are insecure about yourself atleast  thats how it looks like to me  as  a girl  oh  i am a virgin girl  so dont come at spewing shit like  you had sex thats why you dont want virginity to be considered  if not  tell me why your partners virginity matters to you  if its not insecurity its a preference? well  why is it? i mean  given the trend in the comments  most of you want to marry for sex which defiles marriage in itself  which you claim is sacred4  if calling me names  saying i am a weak shit for pointing out the obvious things happening in the society and denying that it happens makes you feel better  well  you do you classic ad hominem oh  you can say that i am generalising  and you know what  maybe i am  because generalizations always have a bit of truth of the society in them5  i wont get a good looking girl if i dont have an arranged marriage oh my  that is so shallow just like a girl asking for 6 figures is wrong  then so is you asking for a good looking girl dont cry foul that women want money and gold diggers when you are just as shallow as them i guess the quote should go  dont judge a person until its time for marriage6  marriage is not a contract and definitely not a pass for sex if you are marrying just for sex    you are pitiful screams lack of confidence in yourself people need to work on themselves  you dont get things you want just by sitting and hoping to get it since  most arguments are from men here  i have noticed that they are happy that they dont have to do anything and their parents get them a bride and sex while the bride gets financial security reminds me of how you have to pay a prostitute to get sex  except here  it has a better name again  i would like to clear that i am against forced arranged marriages  though i am not a huge fan of the business like transaction of arranged marriages  what people want is none of concern people have started bashing it as if i am totally against arranged marriage though  i have tried to counter the points which have been posted in defense of arranged marriage  and i didnt find them convincing  though most of them argue about how arranged marriages are not bad  which i agree its just how it happens here  is bad and i have tried to counter them too  though those have no relation to the whole point of the post which is how many are being forced into marriage and how it is so normalized in the present societyoof  formatting in reddit sucks and i have realized that india has a long  long way to go pretty ironic a country in which romantic movies are usually the highest grossing  shuns love in real lifei am not going to reply anymore  i have tried to reply to every comment but now it has become exhausting have a nice day  everyone,Zea-, i think bigger underlying issue is the idea of life isnt complete or you are not settled till the time you are married i could be earning  financially and emotionally independent but for indian parents marriage is end all be all to every existence more urban parents are getting sort of okay with love or lovearranged but none is okay with idea of no marriage and standing up to them is like death with thousand cuts it starts eroding your conscience  arranged marriages give way to dysfunctional families but i have seen non arranged marriages being dysfunctional as well as dysfunctional people attract each other that type of thing #the average guys wishes he would find love counterpoint dating in india is dominated by players  scammers  blackmailers and entitled ones who throw acid if they dont get what they want there is no place for civility heretl dr dating in india is asking for trouble  deleted  arranged marriages are the only reason why some men in our country get a woman to marry them yeah  grow a spine and like and do as one likes there is no need that only 1 way is correct#x200b i went for arranged marriage as there are many factors in place for me  if one loves someone he can do love marriage  some one likes livein do it#x200b in any case  anything can happen people get depressed after love marriage also#x200b and i personally dont think that its the case of who one can blame after things go south  becoming an adult means that you can make a decision and you have to live with it dating is risky in indiaonly safe dating options are in college or workplace lot of scamners out there arranged marriage is the only route  for people not finding a match at these placesthese days most profiles on matrimonial sites are managed by girls only so i dont see how it is any different from any other dating appregarding courtship  3 years is a bit too much time to understand and then reject a person especially if you are nearing your 30s most indian guys lack the social skills and or social capital to get into relationships theres also the skewed ratio at work here  coupled with the fact that girls are highly and in some cases violently discouraged from being in relationships id say its a cultural flaw  arranged marriages have been the norm for centuries  we never developed the social skills to maintain romantic relationships before marriage the majority  which either doesnt know how to talk to the opposite sex  or cant  has only one chance at a relationship  through arranged marriage which is a hit or miss  with no way to undo what has been done can indians grow a spine  or do you lack the said object yourself op? seems like a big whine if you have a problem with arranged marriages  just dont do one people dont usually date in small towns and villages and they have their right to remain a virgin before marriageand yes its your friend here who has to grow a spine and stand up for himself marriage is not compulsory only if you find a person worth living with  all your life totally agree  way too many idiots  in our country who havent really grown up into independent men and women the arranged marriages is merely a systemic escapism from having to make hard and tough decisions by themselves its the classic outsourcing strategy  removed  counter point  arranged marriage gives an average looking  ugly  desi guy  who invested in academics  a shot at getting a decent looking girl love is all emotional stuff but getting arranged married is a transaction    i have noticed that they are happy that they dont have to do anything  and their parents get them a bride and sex while the bride gets  financial security reminds me of how you have to pay a prostitute to  get sex  except here  it has a better namewhile forced marriages are obviously bad  the idea of confused shy young guys getting a bride by their parents for sexual gratification might seem selfish initially  theres a lot of good things that happen as a consequence if the bride and groom consent since both achieve sexual gratification which is necessary at a young age and most people in india cannot find partners through love marriages since it isnt in our culturealso it makes certain youngsters both boys and girls responsible and gives them directionim not even saying that only the husband works  both may work and raise children togetherits not a perfect process and there will be  disagreements when the going gets tough thats why consent of both is so important with consent the marriage is more likely to be successful than a love marriage since theyve already made a decision before marriage to live their life with a person without rose tinted glasses  so theyve  ideally  seen things which lovers wouldnt have or tend to ignore  oof  formatting in reddit sucksin mobile  not on pc  a country in which romantic movies are usually the highest grossing  shuns love in real lifenot necessarily if you consider the amount of love marriages in this environmentplus look at the number of inter caste and inter religious marriages in the time of open bigotryand i have realized that india has a long  long way to gothere are genuine problems with how arranged marriages are done in the subcontinentthe caste factor skin color  dowry and business and family relationships  groom and bride  often overtake actual marriage requirements of the boy or girl this is a social evil and transcends every religion of course they can not they have a good guy image to maintain  which usually translates to just obeying your parents blindly and staying away from unpopular opinions shit is engraved so deep  the practitioner doesnt get a whiff of it  irrespective of how smelly it is people who are being forced into arrange marriage do need to step up but if the person in picture is not against then everything is alright who is this clown to say one year isnt enough just because he takes 3 years to decide? my way is right not yours hurr durr yeah  obviously you know people better everyone around is simply being assaulted all the time  forced into arranged marriages and they have no say in itseriously  where do such notions even come from? have you tried talking to people around you? most young couples i see in arranged marriages have had their wishes respected and are perfectly happy with their partner it is only in the villages and in some families with issues where forced marriages happennot every arranged marriage is forced marriage and harboring an opinion like makes you a cultural bigot a strong disagree here  i think one has to be realistic and practical about this op probably has an environment where everyone dates for years before marriage personally  if a young bloke asks me for advice on thks  id simply tell him that if they are already in a  physical  relationship with a woman and they like them  marry them by all means as and when they mutually agree but if the chances of winding up with a gf are bleak  either because of lack of opportunity in a skewed gender environment or lack of a nonugly face    then listen to the damn aunty and get arranged marriage once you have a job in the hope for a bollywood like romance  watching yourself become the third  fifth   2k+1 th wheel over time  will only kill you from the inside  and things like sexual compatibility are first world problems its when people are already getting a lot of action and want to optimize it for a common indian bloke  any bandhi is better than his right hand i used to be like you woke and arranged marriage basher during my younger years but ive come to realize that idealism has its limits in the end  in life  the rules are set and everyone plays by them virginity being sacred bowl of puritya virgin would prefer a virgin partner nothing wrong with that those whove lost the vcard are free to ask for a partner who knows what to do in bedalso  arrange marriage helps people get laid at least a guy with a good future and a girl with a clean past get the most out of this system thats the reality bring in the downvotes,2020-02-13 10:44:04

my hometown? husbands hometown?  i need to decide this asap as traveling after 28 weeks april end that is  is generally not advisedwhich brings me to making this post here i want to gather all the information anectodes experiences  in a countdown way  about the dday dweeks if the circumstances allow  i would prefer a normal delivery however  i totally understand how uncertain pregnancies can get i just feel being informed can help us stay less anxious  not panic its going to be long and my thoughts might seem all over the place  so please bear with me here are my questions1  how frequent are the scheduled ob gyn visits in the very last month  assuming a normal pregnancy? currently i visit once a month  for routine check up and milestone mandated tests  flu vaccination  various blood tests  sonography  etc  by scheduled i mean no complication was experienced by the woman or any urgency water breaking  bleeding  etc  occured 2  one lady who had the same obgyn as me when went for her scheduled 37th week visit  was told she will have a csection as the child is getting overweight  weighing 3 kgs then  the obgyn asked her to soon decide which date she would like the surgery to happen and let the doctor know the lady said she however got labor pain the very next day and delivered via vaginal delivery now  i am a little skeptical here  from what ive read  2535 kgs is the average birth weight for newborns in india how can 3 kgs be overweight then? im already very paranoid about the state of deliveries in urban  bigname hospitals and this incident scares me more there is no data public on the number of normal and surgical deliveries a hospital has  so that one can decide  and once youre in  youre in after that  you have to leave everything at the doctor3  one lady who delivered at the same hospital  different obgyn  as me  went at 37 weeks when she felt contractions her cervix was examined twice in a 5 hour span she said she couldnt bear going through that painful examination again and asked for a csection herself  totally fair  my question is  are these cervix examinations by hand so necessary  when theyre leaving the bearing lady in pain? is there no other way  imaging  ultrasound  etc ? my point is those contractions could have been what is called false labor and if not for the pain due to the examination  that lady could have gone home and come again fullterm or when she felt contractions again?4  my sister went for a scheduled visit in 38th week her cervix was examined  she started bleeding she was told to come back if bleeding continued till evening  which it did she had to be operated the next day  after staying in labor room for some 2432 hours this again makes me skeptical about cervix examinations5  whats the countdown going to be like? when does one know that yes  its now that i rush to the hospital should i be scared of just a few drops of blood? should i rush the very first time i experience period like cramps? from my few interactions with mothers  i feel 3738 weeks is the sweet spot where many things happen i know my post gives a lot of distrusting vibes towards doctors  that theyre there to loot us  they try to invent some complication in these sweet spot weeks to push for csections  etc trust me  i would like to be proven wrong hence  im here to collect as much anectodes about false alarms  doctor sending the lady home even after mild contractions as its not time yet instead of asking to schedule a csection  etc as i can5  from what i understand  some women might never experience labor even after 4041 weeks and hence have to be induced are some women induced before that too?

Scheduled,caste conundrum  why do upper castes believe discrimination doesnt exist ?,187,d6qgn0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjt8aBoejho,171,nan,koshyg15, im sorry but this is hilarious but at the same time its sad af especially that thakur guy and that brahmin pandit no amount of education is gonna change people like them and its just sad to say that majority of the population in india is like them  brahman mandir me ganta bhajate hai aur hum logoko bewakoof banate haiits sad to see literates condoning casteism how fucked up is our education system asking upper castes if discrimination exists is like asking white people if racism exists shocking as this may seem  most white people will say that racism used to exist 100 years ago maybe  but not anymoreheres a simple idea 90 of humans are right handed  10 are left handed if you look at all the students who have gotten into college and found that the split between right and left handers isnt 9010  thats an indication that something strange is going on if you see 955 or 991  thats not necessarily an indication that left handers are being discriminated against actively or that right handers are genetically superior  but certainly something to investigate furtherif you saw the 991 split in a saw mill  you might come to the conclusion that right handers are simply better  more hardworking  more deserving after all  the interview process didnt ask them which their dominant hand was  and poor performers are fired if you investigate  youll realise that all your tools are designed for right handers  ask any left hander you know about scissors  and this inherent disadvantage means that they cant work effectively but if you never investigate  youll never find out and even after  if you dont have the will to fix it  nothing will improvewe need two things to solve a problem  figuring out the solution  then implementing the solution if solving the problem would harm us  why would we bother? why would a bunch of right handers fix the tools at the saw mill when it would increase competition for jobs?and that is what reservation does upper castes  approx 30 of the population  would take 7080 of the seats in higher education if there was no reservation you might see that and think fair enough  if thats how the exam results look  thats the way it should be but we could potentially fix this by investing a lot more in public education  in rural education if we paid teachers 3x more  spent 10x on teacher training  5x more on school facilities  we would bridge the gap in 20 or 30 years but we wont because the people with power and influence in society all send their kids to private schools anyway we are not personally affected by the problem of a lack of opportunities  so we have no incentive to fix it  just like the right handers wont fix the toolsif we actually fixed it and india became egalitarian  our 30 of society would only get around 30 of the seats thats a worse situation than we are in currently  where we have 50  why would we spend thousands of crores to actually reduce the opportunities available for our kids? we wont thats why reservation exists  to give an opportunity for the folks who went to shitty schools with shitty teachers a shot at a better life and now you might reasonably ask  but look  what difference does it make? all the benefits go to a tiny minority of people from that caste and you are right but youre forgetting two things firstly in india  people take care of their extended family the first person from a clan to go to college and get a good job mentors their siblings and cousins  pays for their education  brings them up and secondly  although most people from lower castes wont actually benefit from reservation  its still a source of hope for them they are poor  they have no prospects not only that  poor public education means their kids dont have prospects either but they dont know it they delude themselves into thinking their kids could potentially go to college under reservation but this is horrible these poor people are being duped you might think but it works out well for the rest of us  because the day the downtrodden majority wakes up and realises that they and their kids have no hope  they will burn society to the ground the same will happen if reservation is stopped  because that is their only hope of a better lifeno more reservation sounds good but all the colleges have been burned down youll have 100 of the seats  which are now 0 enjoy imho  i grew up in city hyderabad  all my life and i have personally not seen untouchability to the extent where it needs so much reservation  but then i started engineering in 2003 and there was a guy hari who was is a st not a bright lad  didnt speak english low on self confidence and would sit by himself one day we were playing carroms and we only had 3 guys so i invited him to play and he refused and i literally had to drag him to play and saw him smile the first time  we played end of story from then on he would just smile at me and a year went by in second year i spoke to him just casually why he doesnt talk to anyone but these days he started coming to play carroms and tt and he didnt answer and then i pestered him over weeks and he said i did not know everyones caste and did not want to pick any fights  i said what  why do you want to know caste and he said i am a st and people dont like us touching and he sat next to a couple guys on a bench and got to know all 3 were sc sts and over next days he told me stories about how he was made felt in his village i guess people in cities live in a bubble or are not exposed to a lot of atrocities or oppression people in villages face it was still a crazy realization i had until then  but is reservation the answer  i dont know if i show this video to one of my upper caste friends  his caste was once on the verge of being declared as an obc  but after the people of his caste expressed outrage due to provocation by upper castes  it never got declared as obc   he will say that the video is scripted and will say that all of this is made up shit and that untouchability and caste discrimination are very rare today  removed  most people do not base their worldview on statistic tables  but on their personal experiences or taught worldview untouchability  heavy caste based segregation and oppression based on caste based delineation  especially towards dalits  exists we have decades over decades of statistical evidence to prove that but to people who havent grown up in that kind of environment  it is hard to rationalize this with what their acquired worldview is and the first reaction is to vehemently deny it altogether this isnt just caste  but climate change  racism  debates about specific economic policies  kashmir and so onhowever  these kind of anecdotal interviews are about as valid as a privileged tier 1 urbanite going ive never seen casteism  these are fringe cases  etc showing it as a perspective is fine  trying to use it as concrete evidence of systemic caste based oppression around the country is less tenable i am an sc and a benefctor of our great eservation system reservation has only helped me in getting into admission into a tier 1 college  my basics was very weak as i came from a vernacular medium government operated school  even though i got admission  i was still a outcaste  as i didnt have that rich vibes which other general category student has  only solace was that i was good in sports which made me popular in campus let me get it straight   my view is reservation should be there but there has to be a cap and additional regulationreservation should only be there in primary and secondary level of education in premier private  schools  not the government colleges  now  as per present condition my son can avail reservation but i dont think it is required as my wife is a brahmin and i am living in a tier 1 city where atleast my son hasnt faced any such caste discriminationmy building watchmen is a brahmin who salutes me daily to get some tip  if there is a procedure where i can forego my son sc status to his son  then i will happily do it if caste has to be the unspoken thing  first and foremost thing to do is to stop talking about caste self is where the start comes from we cant change elders but we can change this generation and ourselves give this guy a good mic for gods sake genuinely asking what is wrong with a reservation system based on economics instead of caste ? since most lower caste individuals are anyway disadvantaged economically they will be accommodated at the same time rich people who happen to be of lower caste will not be eligible thus allowing some other more deserving lower caste  economically disadvantaged person to take their place didnt watch the video but the answer is simple  upper caste have not faced caste discrimination against them like how the dalits do and hence they feel it doesnt exist often the guys in question actually treat all people well and hence feel this is a mytheven if a large majority of upper castes dont perpetuate caste discrimination  there is sizeable population who do it and also tacit approval from equally large number of people also in my experience in the south atleast  upper castes may sometimes be arrogant but quite open minded most of the caste discrimination is done by obcs end caste system  end reservation its that fuckin simple  removed  even though i dont doubt caste discrimination is there  but youll also have to look at the other side of the picture in urban areas castes are becoming irrelevant one of my school friends just 6 months ago told me that he got a seat in punjab university because he was an sc his father and mother are on also on a government job  money has never been an issue for him here is my take  he didnt need reservation for university because he is from a well of family i have been friends with him for 10 years now i didnt even knew that he was an sc  i suspect he didnt tell because he was afraid of how well see him if he came out therefore i my view  even though there are economic components to this problem but to solve it it will take a social movement where people can be proud of there ancestors even though they came from lower castes  removed  i dont think they will like reservations based on economic conditions either  muslims are one of the  most economically disadvantaged communities in india  removed ,2019-09-20 19:15:13

journal emerging microbes and infections has cautioned that sarscov2  the virus causing the covid19 outbreak  is being shed through multiple routes  so testing through oral swabs alone might not be sufficient a paper by wei zhang  et al  all from the cas key laboratory of special pathogens at the wuhan institute of virology  says investigations on patients in a local hospital infected with the virus revealed the presence of sarscov2 in anal swabs and blood as well whats more  more anal swabs than oral swabs tested positive at a later stage of infection since covid19 is believed to be a disease of the respiratory tract  usually only oral swabs are used for diagnosis  and discharge is based on the oral swabs testing negative the anal positives suggested  they argued  shedding through the oral fecal route  and therefore transmission is possible as well the researchers also showed that a serology test  testing blood for antibodies  can improve detection positive rate  and thus should be used in the future as part of the research  samples  including oral swabs  anal swabs and blood were collected by wuhan pulmonary hospital two investigations were performed the paper describes  in the first investigation  samples were taken from 39 patients  7 of whom were in a severe condition in the second investigation  samples were lifted from 139 patients  whose clinical records were not available when counting all swab positives together  we found most of the positives came from oral swab  8 10  80  on day 0 however  this trend appears to change on day 5 we found more  6 8  75  anal swab positive than oral swab positive  4 8  50  the data suggested a shift from more oral positives during the early period to more anal positives during the later period the current strategy for the detection of viral rna in oral swabs used for 2019ncov diagnosis is not perfect the virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative this observation implies that a patient cannot be discharged purely based on oral swabs testing negative  and the researchers go on to make a recommendation to do serological tests to confirm the status#### about coronavirusescoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that may cause illness in animals or humans in humans  several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging

 previewreddit cjt1cicmiqu41png?width1024formatpngautowebpse226c05d68c73b5d28faccd0aa46ada0cd138105### tl drsince remote work  online education  telemedicine  and reliance on eretail becomes critical for the foreseeable future there is a need for authorities to take specific action iff has written to the dot and trai suggesting that these interventions must look toward overcoming the digital divide  appreciating the importance of the internet and mobile services as an essential utility  and protect net neutrality towards this iff recommends concerted stakeholder dialogue  evidence based interventions to support network capacity  efforts to use government funds towards providing free access to internet services to underprivileged essential cohorts of people  ensuring all areas have access to high speed internet access and expediting the implementation of a net neutrality enforcement framework### backgroundthe lockdown has seen greater reliance of many segments of the populace on information and communications technologies  in particular the internet people are using the medium for various purposes such as remotely working from home  distance learning  ordering essential items via eretail  and telemedicine purposes more generally  people also use it to stay in touch with their friends  family and loved ones  which is crucial to peoples mental health in these trying timesin various guidances and notifications  telecommunication and internet services have been repeatedly classified by the ministry of home affairs as essential items in this regard  the importance of internet and telecommunications access has assumed considerable importance during the current public health crisis it also brings with its own set of policy and regulatory challenges which must be addressed if unaddressed  we believe there is a risk that the novel coronavirus may exaggerate the digital technological divide  stress underlying network infrastructure and risk network neutrality### prior correspondence with the dot and traiin a letter dated march 18  2020 iff previously wrote to the honble minister of communications and copied this to the dot and trai in it we anticipated that there may be a risk of undue pressure on underlying internet and mobile networks due to shifts and likely increases in network usage therefore we suggested authorities1 conduct periodic reviews of telecom infrastructure in consultation with telecom and internet service providers  content providers  startups and consumer facing organisations here  we stressed on the importance of preserving principles of net neutrality2 encourage voluntary pledges by telecom companies towards not terminating peoples connections  due to an inability to pay their bills3 urged the central government to issue an advisory that states and union territories should not issue internet suspension or restriction orders under the telecommunications suspension rules  2017### so why are we writing this time?this is because there are new threats which are emerging  since the commencement of our over month long national lockdown### 1 threat to net neutralityin a letter dated march 21  2020 the cellular operators association of india  coai  wrote to trai requesting for clearance of charges for voice and data for certain websites and telephone numbers additionally  an economic times  report   https  economictimesindiatimescom industry telecom telecomnews telcossuggestfreeaccesstocriticalsites articleshow 74784534cms?frommdr suggested concessions to zero rate certain essential websites pertaining to government services  ecommerce and digital payments applications like the bhim app  without being charged for data during the lockdown periodto be sure  trais prohibition of discriminatory tariffs for data services regulations  2016  which ostensibly prohibits zero rating of data tariffs in india does allow for exemptions however  we must consider such developments along with the fact that coai has also written to online video content providers  to reduce their bitrates to alleviate stress on underlying network infrastructure by referencing measures taken by online content providers in jurisdictions like europe  we have noticed that most participants in the indian market have complied and reduced their offerings to sd bitratesthese measures have been taken by industry and have been taken with little evidence available to the public of the actual stress being placed on indias underlying networks  owing to the national lockdown being excessive indias internet infrastructure has traditionally been characterised as underutilised  and therefore even according to existing capacities should be able to handle a 20 percent surge in network traffic this fact may be contrasted with reports which found that mobile internet use  indias wireline subscriber base remains very less  only increased by 10 percent in the month of march 2020 pertinently  in tier 1 metros the increase was even more modest at 35 percentthus  it may be concluded that without appropriate review and response mechanisms  there is a threat to indias net neutrality regime as such net neutrality in india remains imperfect owing to the fact that we are yet to finalise a definition of what falls under reasonable traffic management practices  and actual means of monitoring and enforcement this lacuna in the framework has meant internet access providers in india can avoid compliance net neutrality obligations  under licensing conditions  with relative impunity we have previously  written to the government about these concerns in march and may  2019 respectively  https  internetfreedomin netneutralityinindianeedstofinditsbearings  ### 2 risk of the digital and technological divideit is reasonable to conclude that the pandemic is sure to hit those working in informal sectors and marginalised communities at large the hardesta recent report on  the print  https  theprintin india education nogadgetsnostudieswhatonlineclassesmeanfor16lakhpoorstudentsindelhischools 406837   and an article by mr  osama manzar  digital empowerment foundation  founding director   https  wwwapcorg en blog defweneedfreetalktimeandinternetduringcovid19  are instructive in this regard the print article discusses how the coronavirus is shifting students to distant learning situations reliant on online ivr based classes educational setups this means that in areas like delhi  students from underprivileged backgrounds are at a distinct disadvantage owing to a lack of digital literacy  no availability of supporting equipment in the household like laptops and smartphones  chargers  and no access to high speed internet connectionssimilarly  mr manzars article also communicates that aside from internet access  many people from informal marginalised backgrounds do not even have access to basic mobile connections as well he illustrates this with the recent exodus from urban to rural areas after the announcement of the national lockdown in it many people travelled in groups to the detriment of social distancing protocols this is because the availability of phones with talk time to make calls  was often restricted to one or two persons in large groups and in such times of hardship  the ability to make a timely phone call to a friend or family member can be a question of life and death### iffs recommendationskeeping the above considerations in mind we urged the ministry of communications  dot and trai to collectively consider the following interventions1 regular review and reports on impact of covid19 on internet capacity india should have twice a week meetings between dot  trai  tsps isps  internet exchange points  cdn providers  cloud service providers  content providers  small businesses  video conferencing app developers  consumer groups and so on  to ascertain the actual impact covid19 is having on internet capacity and quality of service the findings from these meetings along with support evidence should be published for the public at large this will be analogous to the approach adopted by european authorities like berec2 consider means to expand telecom infrastructure capacity although indias internet infrastructure has traditionally been characterised as under utilised  indian authorities must be alive to the possibility that there may be a need to consider means through which it can ease network maintenance and deployment of internet access services india must consider steps in this regard for instance  it may consider discussions with tsps to maintain an open dialogue on the need to expand network capacity  upgrading network equipment  capacity expansions of base stations in mobile networks  etc it should also consider the need to free up access to particular airwaves to ensure networks are up and running in an interference free manner3 expedite final recommendations and implementation of trais net neutrality consultation considering advances being made by internet access providers which seek exceptions to the net neutrality frameworks  it becomes even more imperative that india expedites its finalisation of its definition for reasonable traffic management practices at the same time there is a need for more robust monitoring  enforcement and institutions therefore  it becomes necessary for authorities to conclude its findings on the latest trai  consultation  https  maintraigovin consultationpapertrafficmanagementpracticestmpsandmultistakeholderbodynetneutrality  on traffic management practices and a multistakeholder body for net neutrality4 consider means for free wifi hotspots  access to laptops smartphones and 4g router availability we have urged dot and trai to consider commencing an initiative which deploys funds available under the universal service obligation fund  usof  along these lines  we also recommend they consider possibilities of working with the ministry of home affairs and state governments to gauge availability of funds under the national disaster relief fund and state disaster response funds these funds should be used toward facilitating public wifi hotspots  4g routers  internet devices and so on  in particular targeting benefiting students from underprivileged backgrounds  informal workers  healthcare workers  first responders  and people from marginalised communities 5 urge industry to not disconnect peoples internet mobile services  and provide free data during lockdown period indian authorities and access service providers should identify vulnerable groups who would benefit from such targeted interventions  which help with the response but also help bridge the digital divide we would also suggest trai and dot work together with access providers in ensuring that people can have uninterrupted access to their internet and mobile services even if they fall behind on their payments or recharge schedules under utilised funds in usof may be a useful tool in this regard as well6 urge states and uts to maintain access full speed mobile and internet connectivity during lockdown we urged central authorities to consider ways to limit government powers to issue directives which throttle the internet therefore  we recommended the issuance of an advisory which urges states to not issue any directions which suspend internet access or impose restrictions on accessing high speed internet### important documents1 link to iffs representation with recommendations on net neutrality respecting measures toward

Photography,photography enthusiasts on r india  any suggestions for a good mirrorless camera under 5060k?,18,e7qyze,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e7qyze/photography_enthusiasts_on_rindia_any_suggestions/,6,mainly want to use it for street photography and portraits,photonguzzler, check if you can get the fuji x t30 for that price also if that is your total budget focus on getting a good  glass before getting a camera for street and portrait go with fast prime lens below 50 mm range for apsc that would translate to upto 80mm id recommend canon m50 + 30 f14 lens  if you dont want to spend 2030k on the lens  get the ef adapter and use one of the pancake lenses  24 or 40 f28  fujifilm xt20 with 27mm f28really good combo for a great price are proper dslrs obsolete already? sony a6100 or if you can stretch a bit more the a6400 real time tracking is a game changer,2019-12-08 21:05:57

Photography,i started my btech degree yesterday at the age of 25,2224,ciddbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ciddbn/i_started_my_btech_degree_yesterday_at_the_age_of/,462,for those who are ashamed of going for their bachelors after the age of 21  i started my btech degree at the age of 25 sure the indian society looks down upon you and laughs at you and education isnt encouraged at such old age by societies standards  but i took the plunge heres my backstory  i graduated high school in 2012 scored a rank of 718 in wbjee 2013 and took up chemical engineering at jadavpur university my father lost his job in 2014 due to mental illness and i had a passion for photography i started working as a freelancer photographer to meet ends i couldnt attend classes and by 2015  i had 12 backlogs i decided to drop out and realised chemical engineering isnt for me made some good progress in my photography career shot few promotional events with kareena kapoor ajay devgan govinda etc but opportunities became bleaker as i didnt have the money to expand on my equipments and upgrade and hence by 2017 photography was totally a failure people suggested me to go back and finish my degree my cousin sponsored my studies and i went back to ju  but i hated chemical engineering depression happened and by mid 2018 i had 22 backlogs i wasnt just simply interested in it took the year off to recover from my depression  gave wbjee this year and now i am starting a btech in cse from a tier3 college so by the time i graduate i will be 29i really love front end web development at the moment so lets see where the future leads me a lot of you might ask  why i am going for a bachelors degree  i could have learnt coding and got a job in six months honestly  there are no shortcuts in life i wouldnt want to be a 35 40 50 60 year old who lost his job and is unemployable now just because he doesnt have a bachelors degree i have seen a lot of posts here by people who are 2430 and non graduates and they ask for help this is for those people  even if society makes u feel like a failure  dont let your mind accept that because  u cant change your past  but you can plan and act in the present to build a better future dwelling on the past wont change anything i saw lots of posts from people in their mid 30s to 50s on facebook job post groups  where they took up a job without going for a graduation degree  and now at a much older age they are without any job and much options a smart man learns from his own mistakes  a wise man learns from the mistakes of others i dont know why our society stigmatises going back to school at an old age  but in usa people graduate even in their 50s age is just a number  dont let society come in between your life and your dreams failure isnt fatal  success isnt final it is the courage to go on that counts dont let the past define you today is a new day start again  thanks failure at 25edit  thanks for the gold edit 2 thanks for the 2nd gold and 3rd silver much appreciatededit 3 thanks for the platinumi hope this post can give people a new direction and courage dont lose hope you arent aloneedit 4  thanks for the 4th silver i have received a lot of messages with similar problems to mine and asking for guidance if you are someone  who is reading this and you are stuck in a similar situation  feel free to message me for any queries advice motivation,fuckyallmat, more power to you bro wish you all the best  deleted  25 is still an early age ive known a lot of people who went to college in their 30s and are doing quite welljust make sure you use what you learn and build useful things congrats on bouncing back also  just remember that majority of indian engineering institutions are filled with professors who have no idea about the industry unless youre lucky  youll mostly only end up with a useless degree at the end of 4 years just keep learning new things on the side and build a few pet projects for your resume just my two cents you are an inspiration bro just one thing  dont wait for graduation to start earning money learn new things and start doing freelance work when i was in college  the schedule seemed so hectic that i didnt find any time to do anything apart from study and a little sports but now in job  i realize i had a lot of free time then and could really do better things than just wasting it on bakar do competitive programming  contribute in open source  pick relevant projects  maintain a good github profile and take up online courses on new technologies you have a unique advantage of maturity that most of your batchmates dont perspective changes with age and theres more clarity on what to choose based on how much value its gonna add use that advantage you know there are millions of people who wish they could redo their college days with the same level of maturity and wisdom that they have now and you my friend are living their dream so keep the motivation up and make the best out of these four years that you have thats such an inspiring journey  imo opinion failures are necessary for success  those who succeed without failure cannot grasp the true value of achievements better late than never i was feeling quite anxious today about my career and i am just 21 just graduated  dropped ca  picked up cfa now ive been applying for jobs and so far not much has happened i was feeling defeated but i guess we only lose when we  stop trying more power to you  to me and everyone who needs youll land on your feet because you are willing to work and thats what matters at the end of the day fellow frontend dev here hit me up for any sort of help at any time please get scientific paper published by the end of your  btech  https  btech  contribute to open source projects these are my suggestion a good career awaits you you shall be inspiration for others and me let me know if i can help you in any way good luck i wish there is someway i can reach out to you and hang out     i am also from ju  i started my undergrad in a crappy engineering college at bangalore i loved bangalore  loved kannada people but hated engineering and the college i grew up in jodhpur park  right next to jadavpur university i even had ice cream when the chemical engineering department used to make them as an experiment? i think it was the chem engg dept but i could be wrong you were probably in first year when i was in pg1   i did not face any of the adversities that you do  not even half of them as i read your post  i realized how privileged a life i have had    none the less  dropped out of engineering  joined ju arts as much as people hate on ju arts  they are the most liberal people i have seen there was a senior in the faculty who was also an engineering dropout and he would reach out to every dropout who came to ju arts and encourage them mind you there were plenty and weird as it may sound all of them are doing so well in their lives now    anyways  ju arts turned it around for me i did decently there  went onto get 2 masters and then finally into a phd which i am hoping to graduate next year i am 31 now and ironically i code for statistical analysis now i had dropped out of cse engineering and the only difference is i like what i do now   the moment i read ju  i hoped ju would be the turning point for you  just as it was for me but we all have our own stories and our own journeys to take    ju is and will remain my alma mater and anyone who is remotely connected to the institution as a student is nothing but family     dont let people tell you what to do and how to do it i have had really stupid people both in ju and mostly outside tell me that i would amount to nothing   because i dropped out and because of my age bro  i started my phd at 27  two students i met in my cohort 1 an american african woman aged 41 2 a white gentleman aged 55 who had just retired from american army these two were older that most of the cohort which was by average 35 years old and what a bloody inspiration they were to the phd cohort phd cohorts have a pretty high dropout rate but the gentleman was one of the few full time students who cleared the qualifiers at one go  especially the econometrics paper while the lady was not that good at maths  she fought on and eventually cleared both the theory and econometrics paper they outworked younger candidates like me and brought in all the experience they had gathered to research projects i ended up being really good friends with both of them in fact they are the closest friends i have on campus so no  age is honestly a number and nothing else  fight the good fight  if you ever feel like talking to someone or hanging out  please reach out to me this was actually my last summer break here in the country and i will be in philadelphia for most of the graduating year but if there is anything i can help you with  please reach out i am more than happy to hang out as long as am in the country   and again  fight the good fight  i am sure you will do great   i leave you with a song that i used to listen to when i got depressed in ju about my career trajectory the song was an anthem for us dropouts  pulak da wrote the song pulak da was from philosophy department and died in a road accident i thought you might like this  https  wwwyoutubecom watch?vbvmqxfjtna its never too late to do anything good luck  thats some really inspiring material for someone who has done engineering and pursuing first year masters in psychology at the age of 24 late bloomer but ill surely gonna have a great career ahead wise man learns from others mistakes so heres a mistake i made that you could learn from in my graduation  all i did was try and pass exams i did well in grades  but in terms of learning or knowledge  i didnt have much so i had to go back to basics after my degree dont do this please take keen interest in your classes  curriculum  and additional learning dont be just a literate  be an educated person all the best   more power to you  bro sotti khub bhalo lagche eita poreyi hope you become really big in life thank you for inspiring us to work a little harder its awesome you chose this for yourself never be ashamed to choose education especially when life takes away opportunities  from you unexpectedly you had the chance to grow and you took it thats a win in my bookmy father had taken up bsc in physics and chemistry when he was 16 because my grandfather wanted that for him he had wanted to do btech right after his bsc degree but my grandfather passed away unexpectedly my father was financially burdened at 18 yrs of age to take care of my grandmother and his 4 unmarried sistershe could never pursue btech again and its his biggest regret in life dont listen to society and do your own thing all the best shot few promotional events with kareena kapoor ajay devgan govinda etc but opportunities became bleaker as i didnt have the money to expand on my equipmentsmost of my photographer friends are facing this issue too they have tried to get endorsed by brands but only a few succeeded tough career pathanyways happy for you this post motivated me to get up and fucking study while ive time im a bit depressed regarding the backlogs in my masters hope to get over it soon great for you bro i dont think youll need it but if you want any advice on frontend webdev  just pm me  been doing it for two years thanks man  your post was really encouraging  as someone who failed in previous master program and trying to go back to another master program  i really needed this you are doing a good job going back to your bachelors studies everyone should remember  not everyones situation is the same to graduate by 21 and achieve everything in life life is not a straight line question  what you do for living? i started college in 2013 when i was 18 i got btech it by 22 i had lost interest in most things was probably depressed and also took the bold decision to drop out of college instead of giving make up exams because of  very low attendance coz i was busy playing dota and other games drinking rolling and watching every fucking tv series  now 2 years later beyond the depression and being looked down upon i feel ok the first year after dropping out was hell coz i didnt have any friends back in hometown and my parents kept telling at me all day to learn my dads work and look after iti used to think how fckin shit i was couldnt do btech   anyone can do btech these days wtf  slowly i started going outside doing some of my dads work made friendsim 24 now and life is better i still think about my fucked up life decisionsi dunno if ill ever go back to get some degree but thanks for the motivation small milate jao  large banate

are there such programs for undergraduation? what are his other options?additonal details his mother stays in hyderabad  so  universities and colleges nearby are preferred his mother works as a cobbler and moving to another place is not an option iiit basara is at a remote place and he has to stay in the hostel if he has to pursue the degree  his current college will give a +2 certificate for admissions in a different college he is turning 18 in a few weeks  but abandoning his mother at this time is not looking likely  unless she comes around after we persuade and is prepared for the hardship neither options are easy  please keep the comments constructive i wrote this in a hurry  so  my apologies if i sound crasstl dr which universities colleges in near hyderabad provide option for part time study for a degree related to tech science? ,kasam_se, why not start a gofundme campaign for the debt ? then may be his mother can manage for few months and meanwhile the student can pick up a part time job? i feel the best option here is the student should move out of hostel and rent a house near his college the mother should move in with her son here funds should be raised to support the expenses of both as they are from an impoverished family  i am sure they know how to make do with whatever amount they have  if the mother wants to work  i am sure the college too could be convinced to hire her as a temporary workerthe mother just wants to feel secure and be with her son this is the best way to go about it without disrupting his study if you are not able to convince them  involve the educated community elders of the students family to speak with his family to let the boy pursue his education as finance is the major concern  show them proof of how much their son can earn once he graduates find out their political preference  and involve the local leader  preferably elected official  of whatever party they like to talk with the family to further pressurise them you need to find who has the most influence on the family and try to understand their concern and offer uitable solutions to convince them and thank you for having such concerns for your student  our country is the better for it due to people like you ,2018-07-24 05:44:13

its the students  and the pricing of courses while fee fixation and allowing autonomy is welcome to an extent  but let us not fool ourselves  any hei with half decent infra would need a fuckton of expenditure and the money has to be absorbed from the peoples pockets#x200b a blueprint towards privatisation of higher education not a word has been spoken about quality assurance or the fact of accountability fixation towards private institutes assocham reports that 93 of the mbas in our country is unemployable    https  wwwindiatodayin educationtoday featurephilia story mbaeducationproblems32862620160711  https  wwwindiatodayin educationtoday featurephilia story mbaeducationproblems32862620160711    now lets get into this quandary we want to privatise education without a semblance of accountability towards them really providing people quality skill upgradation let us look into the average unemployability  the private college engineer stands much worse in employability situation than the average nit ju besu  and am not even taking the better nits and iits and iiscs into picture  the whole document promises us lavish words  much promotion  but it speaks zilch about where the funds are going to be raised from in the previous year we had seen how the institute of eminence tag was given to jio institute this meant that they could raise a massive 1000 crores for over 10 years   but we all know the project never even begun  how can we judge its credibility and potential the government did away 1000 crore clause for private institutes temporarily  but there has not been any subsequent clarification on it  thus proving  the crony corporate neta  babudom clout is taking over the education system too#x200b #x200b the report clearly shows that round about 49 of the children who take up education in class 1 do not continue it beyond class 10  the policy sort of considers that  this ratio will be maintained  and we should actually place infrastructure in such a fashion that it caters and provides quality care for the 51 implicitly it has recognized that the rest of the 49 will not come up  and that there would be more stress towards the 51 who continue than bringing up the 49 who are exiting the net#x200b #x200b fails to address the biggest issue  employability  take this in two parts#x200b employability of the lesser skilled  the present government since 2015 has been pushing the skilling agenda furthermore as has been the priorities of the policy  skilling has been mandated as an important part of the dep 2019   it had promoted the ppp model for skilling but the model as sharda prasad report has shown has failed to muster much influence so much so that 995 of the skilling units are government owned the skilling institutes are marred with conflict of interest  malgovernance and the credibility of their skilling quality is pretty poor  once we look into the rates of employability after completing the courses the nsqf framework has adopted a technique of recognition to prior learning  but although the skill of a layman is getting recognized  what is its effective use  if it doesnt lead to any jobs? in the above tone lets also take up the issue of syllabi in vt and diploma courses the course structure in vt is haphazard enough with its whole bouquet of courses  preventing streamlining this means aligning the courses to international requirements  ensuring a basic foundation in the 3rs  and lifelong learning it implies national standards for an indemand skill set with national global mobility that translates into better jobs short duration courses  with no real skills  that provide low pay for suboptimal jobs cannot be called national standards hence the current national standards have to drastically improve   germany has only 340 courses  in accordance with the national classification of occupations 2015  which itself was based on the international standard classification of occupations  such trainees will be a national asset what we have instead are nearly 10 000 standards  produced mostly by consultants there cannot be thousands of standards  compressed into 2 000 qualification packs job roles   and delivered to trainees in a matter of a few months this is not what the national skills qualification framework  nsqf  had recommended the focus should be in strengthening reading  writing and arithmetic skills no skill development can succeed if most of the workforce lacks the foundation to pick up skills in a fastchanging world vocational training must by definition be for a minimum of a year  which includes internship  without which certification is not possible  shortterm training should be confined to recognising prior learning of informally trained workers who are already working#x200b #x200b employability of the higher skilled  the problem of the higher skilled is sufficiently different from that of the lower skilled such a situation has happened due to few reasons 1 promoting a flawed pattern of education for jobs and marks2 lack of requisite jobs in the sectors of choice yojana in 2017 had carried out an important little study where it matched the aspirations of students of hei to the jobs that were prevalant across the state the results were near abysmal  given only few states had above 40 correlation between the jobs they were producing and the jobs that the students were demanding3 putting in a process of hands on education and not  hands free education while the government has been pushing its cause of making innovation an important part for ranking heis and ranking technical institutes and brought in a plethora of schemes to encourage partnerships with such colleges that have a ranking of less than 200 as per qs   the problems involving the lack of hands on education are far more complicated than just that it involves the problem of roi on such innovation  credits system   the push towards quantitative numbers  yes  more the number of papers  and not more the number of papers in journals having high impact factor   the lack of imaginativeness in our educational regime across society  all contributes to the same#x200b #x200b romanticizing of sanskrit and the past case in point  bharatiya shiksha board no  we arent going to become a vishwaguru by promoting cow pee as a cancer cure no  bharatiya and vedic shiksha boards can never be equal to cisce and cbse the skill imparted for doing astrology can only get a person to some vhp shakha  sorry it is never going to a man a job to earn a living promoting pseudo science in the name of tradition is blasphemy#x200b #x200b mission nalanda and mission taxila has said that there will be higher univ in every district   but there is no plan in place the government trying to establish the fact that pushing private people to open and run univs can be good  but that will never be inclusive to remember all those who believe this is some new innovative plan of mudiji  the rusa scheme and its intentions of opening heis across all educationally backward districts was present since upa days the present rewrapping and calling for the private sector gives me only a feeling of skill india 20#x200b #x200b aser and nas reports clearly show the abysmal state of education in our primary levels there has not been one attempt made to fix the situation  rather than a vague policy prescription of interactive education mid day meal and good nutrition might attract and increase the ger at entry level  but it isnt going to solve the learning poverty gap issues  let us not fool ourselves  a country where the average class 5 to class 8 going child struggles to solve class 2 mathematics  skilling is an useless exercise oecds pisa report had ranked us abysmally  so much so that we withdrew participation from pisa and joined it back only this year economic survey 2017 part 1 shows that the learning gap is far greater in girls wrt mathematics in such a case solutions can be manifold should we create a separate situation for girls  where they feel confident enough to take part in maths and science related activities?

name it and its what we experience  ad nauseam change is needed we need it  we demand it  and this being the season of ballot boxes  evms  we yearn to vote to that end tis here  i beg to differ and ask is it really a considerable choice when were given to choose our predators  between lions  tigers and wolves? yes  one of them is way worse than the others  needs to be gone for everyones good  but is empowering the other murderers any better?for as long as i remember  our lives have been spent as slaves  serfs to these powers the fools  bigots  goons  called politicians we elect into leaders  the banks  capitalists  industrialists we sell ourselves to and to each other  caught in their barbaric game of tag  in which were all it in the end i want to change all of that  dont you?they say  everything big  starts small hence  in a world of 76 billion  would it be too wrong to start with our city of 14 million  prided so much for its openness  liberalism  intellegentia? kolkata is our city our commons  our home  enclosed by bigots  greedy gluttons to have created a graveyard for our dreams and for life  especially for the thousands who pour into it everyday  hoping to obtain the collectively acknowledged fictional oxygen  called money  required of us all to exist this is no longer a city  but a corporate heath  bearing concrete in place of vegetationi yearn of you  hence  lets not set aside our differences on who we wish to elect  which fiction we wish to pray to and so on  but evolve our minds to move beyond such gibberish and actually work to make this city sustainable  homely  liveable  post partisanism  post market  post capitalist and really smart  not just a dumb city with proprietary wifi  that the oligarchs deem smart let us build  on this pyre of yesterdays failures  a new city that truly would shower joy on allconsidering todays problems  my wish is to take back the city into our collective hands  as our commons  manage it so  and make it thrive  not grow exponentially of course  when i say take back  i dont ask for a violent revolution of the ploretariat  but establishment of mutualaidnetworks  p2p commoning practices  with each of our houses  condos  etc being its reliable nodes it is impossible to build such a space using current structures  such as the market  a network where people paywall goods  services to exploit each other  accumulate capital  or the state  with its systemic biases of race  religion  etc  the ngo circus standing on corporate social responsibility grants  acting as bandaids distributed by those that machine gun us  and other topdown  vertical  hierarchical  institutions therefore lets start here  as the kolkata commons collective  a mutualaidnetwork  where we organize ourselves horizontally  as equals  and work hard to produce  maintain and common the commons for us all to enjoyin case you think my beliefs to be utopian and my ideas too lofty  the same was  still is thought

no all they want is a shoulder to cry on another person to share all they had in their good for nothing day more interested in opposite gender if you dont have any opposite gender bestie then youre a piece is shit  if you dont have a significant other youre good for nothing  if youre a shy guy who just likes to listen more than to speak then youre not worth dating and whats wrong with this indian system of dating you first start liking the other person then you propose and then you start dating dafaq?  why can you first start seeing each other then start dating and then if things turn out pretty good then youre automatically in a relationship no need to propose for being girlfriend boyfriendim just losing it all  i dont want to be in a relationship i dont even wanna hear anything related with it  all i want is to concentrate on my career cause thats what will start with me in the long run but apparently i cant focus on it anybody of you got anything which might help me? ive decided to change few things surrounding me and with myself1  ill not speak or discuss anything about relationships or my heart break with friends in college anymore cause all they give is very toxic advice like beating up the other guy and so on2  ill try my best to focus back on my career3  ill try pleasuremastery therapywill add if you guys advice something worth it,officialshebu, go through these things maybe it can help you 1 get off social media  right now social media has been linked the number 1 place where one can get depressed easily  by looking at where your friends are and their success and looking at where you are want a hang of social media  do redditing here people dont know you go to the subreddits that interests you talk your heart out   2 get a hobby something interesting like writing  trading in market  photography  which ever takes your interest try it   3 stop caring about society and dont give a shit about it society will be first one to trash you when you do something wrong stop caring about what people feel abot you their thinking is dynamic and will change according to circumstances   4 discover a new outlook towards life 5 you have to survive no matter what life gives you   think of yourselves as company whose shares prices have tanked down to their all time low take decisions that will take the company high dont lose hopeyou go out there and kill itall the best    man this brings back memoriesin the immediate aftermath  i felt like being the worst human being i mean  if being nice still gets you hurt  whats the point of being nice?

Science/Technology, np engineering education in india hot intake  cold results,45,4gbzmf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4gbzmf/npengineering_education_in_india_hot_intake_cold/,18,under the new nda government  there has been a rush to establish a glut of premier technical institutions a proposal for six new iits has been ratified  in addition to the nine new ones already established in 2008 the total number of candidates in the jee  mains  was 125 lakhs this year the all india council for technical education recognizes a whopping 6 378 institutions for undergraduate engineering study  with a humongous intake of 3178 lakh the allindia survey on higher education  aishe  report for the year 201314 pegs the proportion of undergraduate enrolment in engineering  technology and computer fields combined at 2008  second only to the combined field of arts  humanities and the social scienceshowever  does quantity mean quality? does offering longreaching career choices to students not old enough to vote or drink  and parents out of sync with the current market and research scenario fare well in the context of indian higher education?indicators of concernemployabilitythe national employability report published by aspiring minds in 2015 presents worrying numbers that paint a sorry picture it found a meagre 1791 engineers employable in the software services sector  and an abysmal 367 in the software products sector in nonit roles  the statistics were as alarming  with only 65 and 555 engineers employable in design roles in electrical and mechanical engineering respectively the report comments that most candidates lack basic programming and algorithmic knowledge  and in nonit core roles  there is lack of a clear grasp of fundamentals  which is often the only thing required by recruiters in fact  it says that 60 of engineers lag behind by not possessing specific domain knowledge the goto option for a burgeoning class of aspirers  engineering represents the easy path  and a focus on end results eclipses learning processes moreover  choices of specialization are made based on entrance examination ranks  before any taste of specialised curricula or actual field work in a particular subject such illinformed decisionmaking is bound to generate an outpouring of reluctant engineers who are confused and illequipped in their respective areas outputthe other important outcome of technical education is research and development contributing to advancing technology in terms of academic research and patents is an important development indicator  as rd output has direct effects on economic prosperity and standard of living the scimago journal  country rank rates publications and countries in terms of research output in different fields ranking countries by citationsperdocument published  which indicates the average number of times a paper has been cited by other works  we find india ranked a middling 40th among 87 nations with at least 1000 engineering publications from 1996 to 2014 according to data collected by the organisation for economic cooperation and development  oecd  on selected indicators of innovation among labs and higher educational institutions in 2014  we find india comes 31st out of 48 ranked entities in terms of patents filed per gdp as a percentage  including a combined number for the eu  which comes above india  we see how india languishes in the middle in terms of both patents and it the citation counts of academic publications what forces are afoot that drag indias comparative performance into mediocrity despite the colossal undergraduate intake? lets crunch some numbers to get to the bottom of ita chain of causespostgraduate educationresearch output also measures the health of postgraduate and doctoral education in the countries  signalling the willingness of undergraduates to continue in the field of their choosing a report published in 2013 by the south asia development sector of the world bank says that 9456 of engineering students in india are undergraduates  with only 54 in masters programs  the lowest but for brazil at the same time  a 2014 report published by the student exchange and visitor program  sevp  in the united states says that a huge majority  81  of indiabased graduate students are in stem fields this data points to a prevalent scenario in which limited information and social pressure compels undergraduates to pick engineering  but the higher education machinery fails to retain numbers at postgraduate levels  at least in india  students who can afford it fly abroad  especially to the us for search of better options in education and employment the aishe 201314 report also says that only 9 of its respondents who had enrolled in postgraduate courses went on to pursue a phd in the field  which links us to the next issue throttled fundsthe dearth of doctoral students in engineering fields owes itself in no small part to inadequate compensation junior research fellows take home rs 25 000 per month  while senior phd candidates get rs 28 000 moreover  insufficient funds are allocated to science and engineering research  making the production of high quality matter more challenging international science and engineering indicators published by the national science foundation of the usa include the proportion of gdp expended on rd  based on which india ranks 40th among 60 nations studied  with a lowly 081 teacher numbersabove  we saw how small a percentage of students transition to postgraduate and doctoral studies in their fields  and by extension  the number of qualified teachers at college level falls down  denting the prospects of a proper education for subsequent generations of students  creating a vicious loop of negative feedback two other statistics and their comparisons in the above mentioned world bank report signal a severe shortage of teaching resources in the engineering education arenausing general higher education statistics from mhrd reports in 2011  the report estimates the average faculty per institution at 19  and the studenttofaculty ratio at 24 the latter ratio depicts the even spreading of teaching resources  and a high value means lesser attention to every individual students learning objectives to put the number into perspective  the aicte recommends a ratio of 12 at undergraduate level  and 15 at graduate level with betterpaying avenues in regular jobs  most fresh graduates stay away from the lengthy and arduous path of academia and teachingconclusionsthe lack of postgraduates  doctoral researchers  and the best teachers prevents the blossoming of a rewarding academic atmosphere and thus makes departments accumulate reluctant and untrained teachers  by making them unattractive to the best talents  this stunts exposure to good teaching and research for undergraduates  which in turn contributes to disillusionment  insufficient interest and technical knowledge  low employability rates  and a departure from technical fields of work and study post their first degree  feeding the crippling dearth of skills and results at higher

which is often the only thing required by recruiters in fact  it says that 60 of engineers lag behind by not possessing specific domain knowledge anecdotal but i can attest to just a handful of my electrical engineering class of 61 actually understanding what we were being taught the rest were just in in to clear the examsimho  another indicator of the quality of a countrys education is the contents of the text books its homegrown authors produce the indians ones are by and large terrible the focus on rote learning and mindless memorisation is soulcrushing and those guides are so bad its not even funny this problem is compounded when the people teaching you use the same guides to teach and themselves dont understand what theyre teaching i got into several arguments about my scores being docked because id solved something by actually thinking instead of using what was in the book  very well writtenimo  the good faculties are on the look out for good phd students and good phd students are on the look out for good faculties currently  it is hard to find either in india as op mentions  the dearth of doctoral students in engineering fields owes itself in no small part to inadequate compensationfrom the computer science and engineering perspective  there are two sides to this in general  a student who has the capacity to do a good phd is likely capable of working in a good corporate company say a good student gets a job which pays 7lpa if he she stays in the industry for 5 years  this would definitely  atleast  double one can lead a good decently luxurious life with this sort of income now come to the indian phd student he she earns 336lpa + travel + book grants  for 5 years  it is not common to have raises for a phd student  what follows is obviousnow one could argue that a student who is actually interested in research should not bother about money but hell  the student also has a life outside research and needs to have some savings for the future it is not easy to find jobs in india which require phds and do justice to themnow without good students  it becomes difficult for good faculties to want to stay in the country this can  again  be fixed by increasing compensation and freedom for the faculties we need to take lessons from israel a country as big as mizoram  has 9 universities  around 6 of them being in the top 100 universities of the world even though i do not trust world rankings too much  it is sufficient enough to believe that their 6th will be as good as our best how did they manage this? i am not sure  but i do not think nationalism has played too much of a role it is probably due setting up the best infrastructure  inviting the best researchers  giving them sufficient compensation and a lot of academic freedomtl  dr invite the best researchers  give them sufficient compensation  academic freedom students and quality of research will follow can we also use the argument in ops post to explain how so little engineering is actually done in india and how many of the engineering firms are just glorified contractors? http  408perceptionsblogspotcom 2016 08 engineeringininidaiswasteoftimehtml whatch this

how does it serve any purpose? isnt it against the very philosophy of make in india? if you want india to develop  you need to have qualified guardians at the institutions of national importancei understand that india academia is highly influences by leftist ideology which i personally despise im libertarian  procapitalism when it comes to economic ideology bjp is far right wing which has procapitalism as economic philosophy at its core but how do recent appointments justify it? if right wing is about market capitalism  should not bjp give more autonomy to these institutions  instead of screwing up their reputation with highhanded appointmentsi understand top brass of bjp rss feel that curricula of indian education system is against indian culture traditions they also feel that history subject is biased but if they want to change it  shouldnt they do it at the school level anyway institutions like iit tifr iissc iims are mostly about science  technology  technology so  why messing with them?india already doesnt have any univ in the top 300 ranking of qs world ranking with recent highhanded appointments  im sure their quality will take a nosedivethis is pretty much my thoughts let us please discuss it i would request people not to take sides please be objective in your analysis based on logic its not about bjp congress aap its about me and your futureedit what the hell seems  downvoting brigade is already activated cmon yaar  it took me a lot efforts to dig all the relevant info  i would request you not to downvote it please leave this thread if you dont wanna participate,Responsbile_Indian, off topic  but i should probably avoid trying for ftii next year? i dont know about ftii as far as research institutes go  there is a bit of laxity and there is no direction in research most scientists just want to publish papers  and i am not  trying to undermine the importance of publishing papers or basic research  but there has to be a goal of developing technology product which aligns with national policy and interests isro is a good example when a research institute is in alignment with national interests and policy this example is probably a little simplistic because in institutes like iit iisc ncl etc it is harder to define goals and even harder to achieve these goalsto develop a technology which is applicable in the real world  it takes a lot of time and effort and in addition almost every new technology takes a multidisciplinary approach to develop from my experience the indian research institutes lack severely in the latterthere are several other problems as well  but be assured appointment of a member of board of director or even director of an institute will not affect the quality  existing  of research in the institute and the low world rankings are mostly because of lack of infrastructure and lopsided faculty student ratio  deleted   anyway institutions like iit tifr iissc iims are mostly about science  technology  technology so  why messing with them?  because they have failed at their primary goals? negligible research output  unimpressive pedagogy and a vision that is missing in action a bit of a shakeup at the top wont hurt ftii on the other hand deserved better than sri gajendra  what the hell seems  downvoting brigade is already activatedparty before country  rightwingers definition of nationalism  kids have come to power after 60 years    dont worry next elections they are gonna loose for sure and every state elections from now on  ftii  and indian film making in general  is as shitty as it can getpeople say gajendra chouhan is not qualified to be ftii chief i say ftii is so shitty  even a random 40 year old with some life experience can only improve it the one condition is that he she should not come from ftii  or indian mainstream filmmaking  which is just pure horseshit   how is ftii and institution of national importance?second question  why should government be in the business of running ftii but one thing i dont get is why is bjp appointing unqualified people in the institutions of national importance?you have one data point for this  op  just one correction bjp is not far right in the generally accepted spectrum if anything they would be considered left of centre economically  not much separates the bjp and tbh most other parties between the congress and bjp? it is just that the bjp has better execution of projects and lesser vote bank politics youth congress making a mountain out of a molehill just riling up students for no rhyme or reason did upa not make appointments for these posts? did every government not make appointments? this is just a front students  dalits  farmers upa master plan,2015-06-25 07:47:26

Science/Technology,an exposition and solution to the ngo problem,1,28fy7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/28fy7b/an_exposition_and_solution_to_the_ngo_problem/,1,disclaimer i am not the author this excellent essay was written by rudradev brf  ngos are nonprofit organizations whose ostensible role is to fill in the gaps of social service education  community services  such as sanitation and health   conservation of natural resources etc that a government is either too resourcepoor and overburdened to fill  as in india  or is not mandated to fill for reasons of smallgovernment conservative political philosophy  as in many developed western countries there have been many such organizations that would fit todays definition of the ngo  that have in fact done a lot of good in india amul was a farmers cooperative in gujarat that transformed the dairy industry baba amtes organization helped leprosy patients who suffered unjust marginalization and ostracism in rural maharashtra the chipko movement was spearheaded by tribals to preserve their own forest resources the idrf and the rss have been at the forefront of many disaster relief missions as long as these movements are indigenous  draw their support from local volunteers  and function in coherence with deepstate interests  they have been able to contribute important and desirable services of all kindsthe problem  of course  arises when foreign resources are used to support ngos working in india i have a couple of stories that illustrate why this is by no means a new problem in india  and to suggest a potential solution to the problem of filling the gaps in services that have given foreignfunded ngos a way into our systemthe first case involves a close relative of mine as a newlyminted engineer in the early 1950s  he came to bombay to join a government of india concern the concern at the time was inducting a new technology with american help  as part of a usaid program an american had been sent to train the indian engineers in the use of this new technology as part of the foreign assistance package this was a very common arrangement in the first decade after independence  when the gois mission statement emphasized advancements in science  technology and industrythis american had spent some of his early years in dehra dun  and did a passable job of speaking hindi he was a genuine expert in his field  was employed fulltime at a major us corporation  and trained the young indian engineers very well he would also sit in his office after hours  late into the night  typing messages into a telex machine the indian engineers  including my relative  would sometimes wonder what was up jasoosi kar raha hai kya? on one occasion one of the indians brought up the matter with the ias officer in charge of the concern his reply is he teaching you well? then learn from him why are you worried what he is doing or not doing otherwiseand indeed  they were learning a lot from this american  as young men with indian traditional values  they respected him as a guru  and in fact many of them went on to have successful and illustrious careers with the benefit of his knowledge so they let it goit wasnt until 20 years later that my relative discovered  by chance  a newspaper clipping of his old american trainer receiving a medal from us president gerald ford it turned out the american was an oss man who had served with distinction in burma during the second world war  and had been on deputation with the cia in many countries since then  including indiathe point of this story is that this sort of thing has been going on for a long time  ever since india became independent foreign assistance came to india at the gois request to help fill the gaps in governance  such as advanced training  that the goi itself was not equipped to plug often the assistance package came with strings attached  they were manned by foreign intelligence agents  for example more surprisingly the goi knew about this  and accepted it they probably monitored the foreign agents activities  and tried to ensure that they didnt get their eyes on anything too sensitive  but in the interest of the greater good  goi policy determined that it was better to have a cia guy training indians in a new technology than to not have the training at all thats just how the priorities shook outone can almost understand the appetite for these sort of arrangements in a new and desperately poor nation willing to pay a high price to improve its future prospects however  as we know  indias prospects did not improve substantially over the following decades corrupt  selfserving regimes led by successive dynasty potentates showed little interest in building selfsufficiency  in plugging the gaps in governance or indeed  in providing any governance at all thus  what was deemed a necessary evil in the 1950s did not fade into obsolescence by the 1960s or 1980s or 2000s instead  it transformed into an extremely powerful and wellestablished institution in its own right the industry of foreign funded ngos came to dominate every aspect of social  judicial  economic and environmental activism across the length and breadth of india over the decades  it usurped mandates extending far beyond its originally stated purpose of supplementing government services all the while  of course  it never held any commitment to upholding the interests of the indian deep statethe ngo monster reached the pinnacle of its strength under sonia gandhis regime over the last decade  finding its ultimate embodiment in the national advisory council a parallel nationallevel policymaking apparatus  indebted to all manner of foreign interests  that did not supplement the elected government of india but utterly sidelined it in the meantime  every constitutionallymandated institution of the indian deep state financial  internal security  armed forces  judicial  was systematically undermined and eroded this  in fact  is what the ib is warning us of the urgent need to roll backso now to my second story that suggests a possible solution to this problem there are persistent lacunae in social and environmental services that the goi does not yet fill in india  this we all know its also true that the goi has a vast roster of priority issues to fix at a macrolevel  so that however indefatigable mr modi might be  he might very well never get around to taking on these lacunae himself how do we ensure that they are filled by agents with a sterling sense of commitment to the indian deep state?the second story involves a gentleman named mike who was my neighbour in nyc i met him when he was 84  and he died five years latermike was a firstgeneration italian american immigrant who grew up supporting eight siblings in a small town in upstate new york during the great depression this was a doublewhammy italians were racially discriminated against by the wasp majority  and the economic circumstances of the time engendered a sort of starvationlevel poverty  a near absence of hope in terms of access to education or employment  that the us has not known since the second world war endedthe solution came from franklin delano roosevelt  a us president whom mike revered as almost greater than human apart from a sweeping series of macrolevel fiscal reforms  roosevelt introduced a volunteer initiative called the civilian conservation corps as part of the new deal  the ccc provided unskilled manual labour jobs related to the conservation of natural resources in governmentowned lands  creating employment for the deprived while also implementing a general natural resource conservation program in every state and territoryover 3 million young americans participated in the ccc  which provided food  shelter and clothing as well as a small stipend  however  it did something far more important it provided a population on the brink of despair with a sense of commitment  a motivation to serve the community and the nation  and a will to public responsibility it restored the dignity of a generation who would otherwise have been reduced to begging on the streets in the case of mike  and many lakhs of italianamericans  this brought about an invaluable infusion of a nationalist spirit that brought them from the margins of society into the mainstream learning skills as he went along  conducting minor maintenance on public utilities  helping keep the streets and parks clean and sanitary  mike eventually joined the us navy and fought in the pacific as a diesel mechanic on an lst the gi bill  also a roosevelt initiative  gave mike the opportunity to get an automobile engineering degree afterwards  transforming his life  and that of his family  beyond recognitionwhat could have been a wasted life of social marginalization and economic victimhood was transformed into an asset to the nation in every way as one consequence  more italian immigrants signed up to fight for the us in the second world war than the total strength of mussolinis forcesa very similar initiative to the ccc was taken up by the nsdap in germany around the same time the creation of the arbeitsdienst it is derided as fascist in the dominant western narrative of today  but it contributed a great deal to the spirit of millions of young men who grew up in the crushing deprivation of weimar germany but found themselves willing to sacrifice everything for the reichcan we begin to imagine a time when the marginalized sections of our own society arent deliberately kept marginalized for the benefit of ngos who profit from their ongoing despair? where the service left undone by the goi isnt left to foreign agents with no regard for our national interest  but indeed transforms a generation of indians through the very act of rendering that work into the foremost proponents of national interest in the future?,nerds_revenge, remaining essay this can only happen when the volunteer agencies who fill in the gaps left by the goi 1  are initiated  mandated and funded by the deepstate itself  2  inculcate through their activities a sense of mission  dignity and responsibility that serves aspiration rather than victimhood  3  are truly notforprofit  and are not designed to perpetuate their own existence indefinitelythis last is a crucial distinction  ngos which define themselves as nonprofit have a strong interest in maintaining the deprivation of those they claim to help  because their own survival  and the perpetual continuation of their gravy train  depends on it,2014-06-18 21:07:31

as modern humans in africa we learnt to make tools  tamed fire  hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming we left africa about 200 000 years ago  we started farming  domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries   we started to harness the power of fire to make pots  utensils  and brick then we discovered copper  using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire then 3 000 years ago iron was discovered  iron could only be extracted  when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 c wherein iron started to melt from the ore with this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle  ships and communications faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools we made great leaps in terms of medicine  physics  maths and chemistry these technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average and then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production  luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe in less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph   steam ship and sailboat  to a globe that now has video calling  the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand the modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all but this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the stone age leave your religion  open your mind  and be loyal to your species we are all the same and nothing divides us except religion as we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better  but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard

only thing that seems to make them feel alive   is the struggle to survive  but the only thing that they request is something   to numb the pain with  until theres nothing human left  just random matter suspended in the dark  i hate to say it  but each others all we got religion is the main cause of unrest in india religion is one intense fandom religion is legalised madnessedit thank you for the shining silver kind stranger  deleted  to all those parents and students who called moral science classes a sham  this is why we needed it religion is an expired product that has continued to stay it should have been eradicated or died a while back but has not if we as species have to reach next level then we need to get over religion any existing religion is like superman  did wonders on paper but doesnt actually exists when you call yourself an indian or a muslim or a christian or a european  or anything else  you are being violent do you see why it is violent? because you are separating yourself from the rest of mankind when you separate yourself by belief  by nationality  by tradition  it breeds violence so a man who is seeking to understand violence does not belong to any country  to any religion  to any political party or partial system  he is concerned with the total understanding of mankind jiddu krishnamurtiquestioner   kindly give a straight reply does god exist  or not? yes  or no? if yes  how best to realize him in this life?jk  if you examine very closely  you have created god right? in india there are about  i was told there are about 300 000 gods and more  laughs  you understand? every local person has his own godso  sirs  we have created god see the irony of it thought has created god and then thought worships the image which thought has created which is  to worship oneself and call it god you understand all this?  the better part of you is god right? i wonder if you understand this first of all  lets be clear have you created god? the local gods round the corner  or the local god in rome  or in tirupati  or wherever  you have created them  havent you? you are so very uncertain  arent you  so frightened if you say we have created  then you are scared stiff because you have created out of your fear that out of your fear you want security right? you want safety  you want to feel there is somebody looking after you because you are afraid you follow? so you create that  and then worship that just see what you are doing going to tirupati and putting all your money in the bag  do you think gods want your money? sir  look at it all you have nothing to offer but money  garlands  prostrations  rituals right? you have nothing else to offer have you realised the tragedy of this  sirs?if you love  not god  thats very easy to love god because it is an abstraction  it has not much meaning but if you love  that very love is god  that very love is sacred you wont go outside to look for god you understand all this  sirsand the questioner wants to know if i believe in god i dont because god is something created by man there is such a thing as eternity  which is to be outside of time right  sir? for that you must have a mind  a heart that is completely free from all the burdens of life right? from your vanity  your arrogance  your selfishness  you follow  sir? and we say  we are not capable of it  tell us what to do you are back in the cycle  somebody to tell you what to do sir  you are in a jungle  you have to walk through it by yourself right? and for that you need vitality and vigour and strength not belief in god  in goodness  belief has no place where truth is concerned right? if you need divine  reward to do something good or you have fear if you do something bad something bad will happen i think your are a piece of shit just be kind to the people help them if you can and for the world sake stop protecting your religion this post is pure goldreligion destroys humanity not build it all cast system  racism  homophobia

ahhh   i see you are a man of culture as well its really my imaginary friend is so much better than yours were not going to get blown out in a supernova  the suns too little religion is a massive waste of time it has outlived its utility this is why i believe in my made up goddovah a dragon from skyrim i personally believe that religion is for those weak minded people who cant face the music and always need some kind of support  was one of them  there was this really nice quote from mib an individual is a smart person perfectly capable of making his own decisions  rational etc but crowd on the other hand is violent  easy to provoke  and has nothing but a common herd mentality now dont get me wrong i do read sometime bits and pieces of religious text which are some really well thought

take care of othersi am a 30yearold  socalled general category lowerclass family  man haha  how pathetic  isnt it#x200b i was a good student till xth  and then the slow downhill started in my scores struggling to pass 12th in state medium with 70 with just pass 50 in mathematics#x200b then  coming from a lowerclass family  there were not enough choices for me to go through  either medical or engineering i prepared for medical taking a 1year gap nothing substantial came out of it in the end  i had to go to engineering because sadly  in our country  gap years are a strict nono for any of the stakeholders and i could not waste 1 more year#x200b did  btech  https  btech  in engineering in applied electronics  instrumentation from one of the good private colleges in bhubneswar  odisha yes  here in odisha  so you might have guessed my economic conditions passed with average cgpa of 71#x200b no jobs came in the engineering field at last  i was recruited by the service company  name starts with i  and had to go  for it  this was 6 years backwhy?because there was no alternate way for me i am now the sole breadearner of the family my dad has retired from his jobtrained in mysore  i was not from a programming background i found it really hard to go through the training especially the advanced chapters i had to take a retest for the final exam since i failed in the first one in the retest  i literally had to take the help of some kind souls who took pity on me and shared their answers i passed with a retest with minimum pass marksgot posted to mangalore here  literally at the opposite side of india from where i cam from  i felt alone loneliness became my best friend i avoided getting into any projects there   be it support or development because i knew in my heart that i could not do itafter a gap of almost 1 year there  i was forced by some managers into a support project in this team  seeing my utterly bad skills  they put into a 1st level support person  a triage one  someone who acts as the first point of contact for customers  records their issues  creates incidents  tickets and passes onto other teammates literally this for 1 yearthen  slowly they put me into an application support where sql work along with a niche technology called tm1being absolutely weak in any other technologies  let alone niche technologies  i could not really improve upon my situation   thus  they kept me in a bare minimum work state in this one too because frankly i could not doa anything elsei remained in this project for 45 years  then took a transfer to bhubaneswar here  i avoided again  getting into projects for 1 year or more and then was again forcibly put into a support project where informatica  unix  tm1  cognos is being used i am in this one  at presenthere as well  seeing my lack of skills  i was put into a bare minimum level my lead has literally scolded me so many times that i have become numbbelow are not excuses or points to validate my inactions  they are just plain naked truthsnow after all this  you and hell  i would have asked myself what i am doing about it?what i am doing to learn new skills?what am i doing to even get into

proficient in a programming languagei lack the logical reasoning a person has to learn to actually codei lack the mathematical skillsnow would you believe me if i told you i had scored 100 100 in my xth computer science exam  consisting of oops  and blue javabut now  i know what utter waste was that  not worth 2 paise in india and in this hypercompetitive world#x200b since these 6 years now  i have remained severely depressed with ocd patterns coming in as well my memory has faded my enthusiasm is gone for anything nihilism in my mind i have tried to come out of it  i am not saying this lightly i have tried to take away my mind on dwelling on these things and escape through any of the multiple options for a person to get some enjoyment  songs  podcasts  movies  etc but nothing works i  after doing any of this  feel an existential dread as to what i have done in my life to deserve this moment of just happiness says while going to a movie or hearing to some podcasts guilttripping at its finestsometimes in the middle of a day  i see something or think of something and i break down tears and only tears even on a bright day at night  tears are my only friendyou might think  where are my friends or family who can help me the answer is i really do not have any such friends whom you can call at 2 am and speak your sorrow and get a shoulder to cry onmy family  well  they had high hopes for me my dad and mum had put everything to get me a good education and now i am in such a state they are slowly coming to the conclusion that i am an utter failuremy lifeline has been shredded

different i didnt get any decent job for about 2 years after i finished my btech when i got one after a year or so my company decided to close the unit and everyone lost their jobs then i started to teach few students and decided to try for government job even cleared all the exams but failed to get into final selection list then i joined another company and there i got into an accident i severely damaged my arm and doctors told me to avoid heavy work for at least 2 years later i took few steps back and started to teach in a college as a part time assistant lecturer even after all the bad luck i never felt hopeless i am still in search for a decent job but i always try to be optimistic i recommend you to get professional help before hurting yourself you sir  are not a failure you have managed to persevere till this day even with the constant downs in your life better things await you in your life from here on try getting a professional help as i have heard many people here saying that it really helps and lastly dont lose hope please dm we can talk i can totally relate to the post dont take this step and take some counselling asap you should try giving highschool

whatever you need  well help you ive already lost a brother to suicide  i will absolutely not let you do this pm me   were here to talk to you dont be dumb dont do this reach out im here for you buddy  you should hone your skills in some other field when you have the free time  even if it doesnt reap any financial benefits reading this post  i feel that you should give writing a shot just because you do not have the skills to do well in one isolated field does not mean you are useless it is a very childish reason to feel any sort of guilt hope you see things the way they really are have a good day  deleted  this is the state of mind of all non successful it guys  trust me i have seen few of my useless colleagues getting 2x package jump in new companies and i am still at the same company   it feels bad to see non talented people getting good jobs  but life is that way   just be happy with whatever job you have   just dont compare yourself with the guys getting better pay  compare with those who dont have job at all hey man life is a long marathon you havent even completed the first set of laps it sounds like you have a job but youre not motivated at it but you dont want to quit just yet and try a career change thats fair why dont you throw yourself into learning something relevant to your career? go back to the basics and relearn things again youll be impressed by how much youve learnt that youve put into practice there are lots of free courses out thereit also sounds like you are having a difficult time at work we dont talk about our emotions often in india why dont you ask your team lead out for lunch on a weekend or something? say you have something important to tell them and ask them to meet you outside work be honest and tell them about your challenges and your hopes and ask them if they can help you in any way you would be surprised at how people react to honesty frankly  it might make the person relieved because its much easier working with an existing employee instead of finding a new one and training them from scratchthe other thing that seems to bother you is the fact that you seem to be the breadwinner if thats the case then why dont you have a discussion with your dad and figure out how much the family needs monthly so that you dont stress yourself out by thinking you need a much larger sum than what you actually need?all in all  it sounds like youre aware of your problems thats a good sign never underestimate the power of selfbelief you just have to do better today than yesterday friends are not disappointed in you and they dont want to avoid you theyre just waiting for you to reach out hey  yes you listen to me dawg theres nothing in this world thats not achievable and i mean every word of that sentence i think its right to tell you that i know how youre feeling and what youre going through as i was in the similar situation just like this where though of taking my own life also struck my mind everyone around me thought that i was an abomination but little as they knew  theyre the same people telling me what a change i made in my life towards a better future i know what it feels to have no friends or family

Science/Technology,calculus created in india 250 years before newton study  technology  science,147,2p81f0,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/calculus-created-in-india-250-years-before-newton-study-1.632433,146,nan,sjain75, awesome i read about this sometime back  but it was speculation and not the conclusion of a study thenanyone interested in reading viewpoints such as of these researchers should read the indian clerk  a book about ramanujan and his time in england people are arguing that the taylor series was proof of invention of calculus bitch pls be proud if you want to but get your facts rightwhile i understand that the taylor series is a very important concept in calculus  it isnt necessary to combine the ideas of infinitesimal sums and differences  convergence  divergence and limits to get to it the form newton and leibnitz fought over inventing was one which had these concepts  as evidenced by newton promptly using it for his kinematics work so no  in the true sense  i wouldnt call this the invention of calculus but its an absolutely important step there nonetheless something which neither newton nor leibnitz had set eyes on  so careful before you start accusing them of plagiarizing  these are real indian achievements i have no idea why the wingnuts insist on tomtomming the taj as a shiv mandir when there actually are real things to be proud of  really  this is new? i thought madhava and the taylor series has been known for a quite a while now newton wasnt even the 1st european to develop the calculus  a better title would be medieval scientists in kerala invented infinite series centuries before the westthis is indeed admirable  but please do remember that calculus isnt just about infinite series  the concept of limits  infinitesimal small changes and their infinite sums is crucial infinite series is just one part of the stepping stones to calculusregardless  this is definitely something to be proud about its interesting to see proper research into the indian history of the maths  sciences and economics  since this is severely lacking in our narratives of history however  using clickbaity headlines is a bit disingenuous  but to be expected it is a 2007 article  going by the datethere were many reasons why the contribution of the kerala school has not been acknowledged  he said a prime reason is neglect of scientific ideas emanating from the noneuropean world  a legacy of european colonialism and beyondhowever  he concedes there are other factors also in playthere is also little knowledge of the medieval form of the local language of kerala  malayalam  in which some of most seminal texts  such as the yuktibhasa  from much of the documentation of this remarkable mathematics is written  he admitsi think mr gevarghese george  who sounds like an indian  has got his primes mixed up the brits were rather interested in what we had discovered and what we believed  if the journal of the asiatic society is anything to go by i would say that the prime reason is what he accepts as other factors  something for which the blame lies squarely at our own feeti think we have done much more than just this  in advanced mathematics and astronomy and then let it all go to seed  this is mentioned in wikipedia in the 14th century  indian mathematician madhava of sangamagrama and the kerala school of astronomy and mathematics stated components of calculus such as the taylor series and infinite series approximations however  they were not able to combine many differing ideas under the two unifying themes of the derivative and the integral  show the connection between the two  and turn calculus into the powerful problemsolving tool we have todaythe researcher of this article is george gheverghese joseph from kerala  v invanted calculuss  removed  shocked that i havent seen a so prod v invant comment here so far anyway  now that western scientists have put this matter to rest  i am sure our fellow randians are convinced otherwise we would have seen a bunch of disparaging comments about the people who say anything along these lines secular feathers will be ruffled kya ukhaad liya calculus invent karke everytime someone comes out with statements like this  especially if they are right   the natural question that arises is  then what the f are we doing with our garbage heap of an education system  rote learning  utter absence of creativity  and spectacles like a daytime drama queen  literally  as the person in charge of education  chokehold of bureaucracy  anaemic support for higher education  and research  07 vs 3 of gdp that all of our competitors have ? it must have been invented we had a very skilled and glorious past even scientists today r baffled by indian architecture which was created in past the ashoka pillar is the iron pillar standing in open since years without any rust  and taj mahal ajanta ellora paintings etcetc but sad truth is today we are a third world country with poverty population explosion and corruption just coz ur father was a rich n successfull businessman doesnt mean u keep on doing nothing and encash on his name hope this is clear not sure  why we always want to compare our civilization with western one seems like we still have the inferiority complex because western one ruled over us we know  india is one of the oldest and great civilization a lot of was discovered and invented in india but can we focus on how what we are today even if calculus was created in india  no one can deny that leibniz  newton and western civilization reinvented it  documented it  promoted it  applied it and made it part of math curriculum so even if india  created calculus  stop finding reasons for how great we were  and discuss on how can be great today calculus is indianmlecch_certified where is the anti kulcha people now doesnt matter  because issac newton was indian too he was kidnapped from yamuna vaidhshalaya  university  and brainwashed by white people his real name was isayu nathuram look it up on subramanian swamys facebook page if you dont beleive me so we inveneted calculus either way so prod of r kulcha doesnt matter issac newton  ishant nutan  was actually of indian origin his father had emigrated from india  that is why his father forced ishant to learn sanskrit which was responsible for ishant creating calculus itt  not history not a lot of math  does not compute at all,2014-12-14 15:06:33

Science/Technology,the most terrifying moments india counts down to risky moon landing   if touchdown is successful  chandrayaan2 will be the first lunar mission to explore the south pole,1736,czf5wi,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02587-4,217,nan,I1I8I1I, fingers crossed but i am sure it will be successful wishing all the very best to isro for people asking why isro is doing thiswe need to explore moon to find if we can set up a base so that it will be like a pitstop for deep space missions to escape earths gravity we need more fuel but moons gravity is very weak so we can carry more fuel and more cargoto set up the base we need to find if we have sufficient water and other essential minerals also to check if we can extract rocket fuel  so that we dont have to transport from earth for isro along with all this  its the first step in sending landers and rovers for deep space missions like mars sending rovers and landers to moon is relatively cheap compared to mars if it fails so they are doing it step by stepedit thank you kind stranger for my first silveredit why we need to do deep space explorationbecause we have such a big universe with so much energy and resources we are fighting for limited energy and resources here  but if we could tap into the energy and resources of the whole universe including our own sun by building a dyson sphere  we will have unlimited clean energy then all the climate change problem  everything can be solved in an instance we already have technology to convert carbon dioxide air into solid carbon but we are not doing it everywhere because energy requirement is highif you go back in history  the last dominant species of earth dinosaur died when an astroid hit  because they were not technologically mature we have the technology to track astroid  but its too difficult to find all astroids in the dark space it may not be the astroid that will end the human species it may be something else  so to change our fate we need to explore to find a new home for that deep space exploration is important also we as a species are explorers that is why we have colonised the whole earth  next step is the solar system  may be mars and titanone of the jupiters moon if something were to happen to earth its impossible to save everyone at least with the current technology  but we can definitely save the human race here is the thing about space exploration if you arent doing it yourself  down the line you will have to pay exorbitantly to someone who did its simple as thatif isro wasnt doing its thing all this while  we wouldve been paying some other countries to launch our satellites and stuffs  military tech and for million other reasonsso if you are questioning why its important to explore moon and other places  its not for you maybe its for the next generation  or the one after that or 10 generations from nowdo we owe it to them? hell yeah why? because whatever shits we are enjoying right now wasnt created in our own generation with our resources  and so onus is on us to be not dicks and handicap future generations mereko aisa dhak dhak sa horela hai bhai lund kara de  500 extra le lena thanks for posting an article from nature instead of garbage news sites the lander of chandrayann 2 named vikram will land on lunar surface on 7th of september when its rover pragyan will roll out from vikram to carry out experiments on the lunar surface for a period of one lunar day which is equal to 14 earth daysthe lander has already left the orbiter and is descending toward the moons surface i wish everything will come out well as most of the citizens have set their hopes on this mission and their hopes and expectations will do wonders fingers crossed since i am seeing a lot of negative comments on why we are doing this   wouldnt it be better to use this money on education   other things dude  this is not much money and education and other things already have budget allowance we arent even using that money optimally  so throwing money to other things is not an answer also  what do you want from our high iq scholars? work in banks or become ias instead of becoming scientist  or migrate to nasa? which most of them are already doing you want to stop brain drain and want those nasa scientists to return to india  but dont want create jobs for them also  our satellite and space data can predict cyclones  weather and other things should we shut down isro? we spend more on mayawati statues  cricket stadiums and politicians foreign trips then on isro so the reality is  isro budget is not enough  and we need to increase it to support science terrifying ???why is this word being misused in many chandrayaan articles who is being terrified terrorised and frightened ?it gives the impression that the scientists are just blindly doing things without confidence  hoping that it touches down or like a student who has not not studied at all  appearing for examsa more suitable word could be challenging  suspense etc astronomy noob here please elaborate whats the context of exploring south pole? moons south pole or earths south pole? all the children in the comments who are arguing whether this mission is needed or not  its adorable fingers crossed if they lose contact just tell tapsee pannu to switch the control system on and off once  sall the best a major question in the comment section is how will space exploration help common people or why is space exploration necessary heres my two centsspace exploration is the pinnacle of science and technology it is the region where we push the frontiers of knowledge  wisdom why push stuff you ask?

angry journalist barking  where is the chairman  why is he not facing the press as if he has fled away after a scam such a scumbag ok so some retards are already out with wastage of public resources in a country of poverty rhetoric  heres the thing    total mission cost was 900 cr  a minuscule portion of total budget    india doesnt actually spend that much money on the space program bjp spent 27000 cr on their 2019 election campaign   indias space program actually helps in alleviating poverty  by creating jobs  by helping farmers and fishermen by tracking weather activities  by educating poor people through edusat etc it is so painful to watch the isro chairman crying no matter what is the outcome  i will stand by with isro  and i will fight internet battles on their behalf  fuck anyone who thinks isro is not competent enough or perhaps weve just forgotten that we are still pioneers and weve barely begun and that our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us  because our destiny lies above usa quote form interstellar  removed  what makes it all the more hard to swallow is that the country has  naively    come to expect a near perfect track record from isro sometimes its easy to forget that what were experimenting with is quite literally rocket science  getting a nation full of people who say space programs are a waste of money to be glued to their tv sets at 2 am in the morning is an achievement in itself isro has just inspired a lot of young minds to take up space science as a field of interest instead of youth saying i want to work at nasa  we might find them saying i want to work for isrowake up vikram you have a lot more people to inspire    deleted  that journalist pallava bagla was a complete asshole for being so rude at the press conf well done  isro  the lander didnt work out  but youre still in orbit  and collecting data  thats a big win in itself  your flag will be on the surface soon enough one kid is literally asking how to become president personally im still hopeful all the banter  name calling and vitriol aside  godforbid if communication doesnt get restored  you guys should really be proud of the monumental and prolonged effort and skill that went into reaching as far as you have reached this is no small feat for a nation every moment of this mission has provided your scientists valuable information information that which was not handed to you by another country these sort of attempts contribute in building a culture of making attempts in previously uncharted territory we all know success greets those who make attempts everybody who tries something for the 1st time will be at a disadvantage  learning from it is where its at success after such setbacks is sweetest and much more meaningful imagine how many indian kids in school will be inspired imagine how many more indian young adults will be part of the next mission that is how you teach a nation to dream big having ambitions that traverse petty human squabbles is what gives a nation its future today is a historic day for you all its another chapter added to the story of india 1520 years from now many of you will be sharing with your kids the story

tradition of sorts  https  internetfreedomin arepublicdayletterfromiff   at iff to use this occasion to reflect and also indicate what small role we hope to play in support of our constitutional ideals## india stands on the edge of a technological precipiceover a year  iffs work has strengthened on the basis of the generosity and support of many volunteers  collectives and organizations in many ways  our advocacy has merely been a topdressing to a richer foundation prepared with the time and labor of others today our mission is stronger both in our ability to do our work and cause impact due to these networks of sharingto  cause change over the last year iff has done substantial institutional  engagement on issues ranging from net neutrality  free expression   privacy and innovation these are publicly documented on the website and  i invite you to go through them as we grow capacity  our work will  become more technology  campaign and public centered this is not to  say  there have not been attempts over the past year iff has become  better at collaborations with other individuals and organizations  primarily in the fields of community building and public talks we would  like to believe we are contributing to greater partnership in the  domains of design  law and computer sciences which are talking to each  other more regularly than ever beforewe  have tried to swiftly respond when citizen needs have arisen on issues  such as intermediary liability  malware hacks  surveillance drones   facial recognition and internet shutdowns this has been followed up  with persistent representations  rtis and even court challenges our  greater realization is that much of this work interacts with government  institutions it often requires a fresh set of regulations and by its  very nature the results are tangibly felt in the medium to long term to  accelerate timelines  one of iffs missions has to be to complement the  power of movements with building resilient organizational capacityfinancial  sustainability is vital to make such policy victories a practised reality we have approached fundraising and our expenses with  civic  legitimacy  discipline and transparency  transparency is major component of our website redesign that will roll out in may  2020   we have focused on implementing a model of individual giving and  recurring donations that provides five membership tiers and receives  funds only from indians these have helped us achieve a marginal level  of predictability in fund flows and a continuous channel of feedback and  coownership all of this is a process of iteration and learningwe  need to do more to come close to our projected revenue targets that are  accommodated by the generous buffer provided by organizational donors  many of them have donated to iff after learning about our work through  our members who have championed our cause to their management we are  thankful to each one of them  for helping us do our work independently  and even providing us an opportunity to have conversations with them to  explore how digital rights can help improve user trust in their  productstoday  donations help fund 3 staffers  an offcounsel soon 2 more people will be hired to secure   the values of the indian constitution as put forth in the preamble  all iff volunteers  staff and leadership are guided by a sense of  urgency  recognizing that each day is a call to action to defend your  liberty  equality  fraternity and justice in our digital republic dr  b r ambedkar  put it best  just before the

are some people out there who give a damn about what this government is trying to do with data thank you for this good luck with the contributions can someone add a general tag for the sub im tired of hate and protests appreciate the effort to raise awareness about and improve privacy  among other things  in a country where whatsapp from facebook permeates the digital realmanother topic i have strong  negative  opinions on is pornography  and since www is the most popular medium for it  i decided to look up iffs stance on it and found a couple of relevant articles that id like to comment on here since there is no ability to do so on the site itself by the way  is the ability to comment on articles being considered for the upcoming revamped website? perhaps this would fall under feedback and coownership mentioned here along with the publish dates of articles  itd be good to see the authors name somewhere as well to be able to compare their views over time in different pieces its not exactly clear from the positions listed on the  about page  https  internetfreedomin about   who the editor isfollowing quotes are from  https  internetfreedomin porniscomplexwecallforfurtherstudy   https  internetfreedomin porniscomplexwecallforfurtherstudy  while porn is problematic for a multitude of reasons     the principal regulation in india for it originates from victorian sensibilities #x200b why should our lives be governed by british era laws on obscenity? help us fight victorian sensibilities in 2020#x200b it criminalises healthy adult behaviours and represses desire#x200b more worryingly existing criminal provisions on obscenity are being used for criminalising political dissentall are unsubstantiated claims presented as facts how was it concluded that porn regulations in india come from british era laws or victorian sensibilities  im assuming the v was intended to be capitalized ? afaik  they were only blocked in the past few years  and if anything  victorian influence on india and its people would be decreasing over time are you saying that porn wouldve been aok in the society of precolonial india? the language used here seems rather manipulative to me healthy adult behaviours and represses desire so  the thousands of years that humans spent without pornography were unhealthy and repressed? criminal provisions on obscenity being used to criminalize political dissent id be really interested in seeing an instance where political dissent was criminalized did it mean to say suppressed? would still like to see where that happenedon to  https  internetfreedomin whyispornbeingblockedinindiawhattheblock   https  internetfreedomin whyispornbeingblockedinindiawhattheblock  finally  we recognize the concerning psychological impact of porn production and consumption but we do believe that when viewed privately  it falls within an individuals right to free speech and privacy this certainly does not include pornography which has minors present in it  or is created in the absence of consent to make and view pornography belonging to both these classes is not only a crime  but a deep moral stain that results in long lasting physical and mental harm to the participants who are exploited for its productionminor meaning physically under 18? how would you determine that from watching a video? what about cases where an actor is physically an adult but lacks somehow in their mental capacity? would their consent really count? what about videos where all involved individuals are adult and consenting to the act  but are unaware of being recorded  so  a lack of consent there  but its not apparent in the video ive personally come across such cases irl  and on the webwe acknowledge that the ethics of mainstream porn production  particularly the portrayal of women and other minorities  merit study and examination    at present  we maintain that pornography production requires greater diversity and strict enforcement    these are issues beyond the scope of our expertise and we look for leadership from feminist and sex workers rights organisationsother minorities? greater diversity? feminist leadership to deal with porn related issues?  its sort of ironic that both articles complain about british colonial victorian influence in india in 2020    why admit that these subjects are beyond the scope of iff but then push for porn when its apparent that there are many issues surrounding itiff will do what it does best  which is fight for internet freedom and the choice of individual internet users in india this includes the private consumption of content that is deemed obscene under antiquated  colonial laws which should not find space in modern  progressive indiathe content is deemed obscene even in modern western world  let alone india  which is why there are 18+ age confirmations on the porn websites if it werent deemed obscene  you wouldnt need the private in there  so the statement contradicts itself  really,2020-01-26 21:27:13

story,635,cep1qe,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cep1qe/trust_yourself_and_do_what_you_love_it_works_out/,135,i am rather a poor guy  who lost his father at the age of 3 raised by mom who worked at a private school  i opted for science after the board exams realized i wont even pass  had to fight with family members to change it to commerce and i passed with 57 marks came to mumbai to study ca  estimated around 25 lakhs as fees  expenses   couldnt afford that  i  had interest in technology so decided to pursue it instead learned computer engineering  hardware networking  for one year  and got a job at a mnc  worked in that field for 6 years i was just 17 when joining this job  a didnt complete my graduation around 5th year in my job i realized i had more interest in building things on the internet than fixing active directory problems i started learning more and more about it  and build a real blog which got decent visitors and started to make some money  but to really make something worthwhile i had to dedicate more time  i used to live in virar and traveling to andheri  mumbai  every day for job took 9 hrs + 4 hrs of my time and after that hectic peak hour mumbai local the body simply didnt want to work anymore  so in around 2013 i left my job and decided to move full time into internet marketing my wife  her parents and my mom all thought i have gone mad and pretty stupid and honestly thats pretty much fucked up if you ask any one of that age for next 12 months i built websites around local businesses in uk   ranked them and sold the leads to two companies the most successful of them was one was around heavy transport vehicle driving training the company paid 35 per lead and i made more than 4k per month  around 2l in inr  with it  this boosted my confidence and i invested most of those funds into experimenting and investing in digital marketing i used to post my screenshots on facebook  in 2014 a random dude msged out of nowhere and asked to meet   he looked confident and we meet at a google conference later that week  we discussed what we both has been doing he had lots of contacts at emerging companies and i had the skills  strategies   and contacts to actually delivery successful marketing campaigns   it was a promising match and we end up forming a company together we built a digital agency  the first client he brought gave us over two crores in revenue we quickly built a team of about 40 ninjas and went on to become a very successful company in next 3 years we worked with more than a dozen listed companies  3 fortune 500 company and made a lot of money for ourselves  at materialistic levels  just last year he bought a very expensive car  80 lakhs   travelled to over 30 countries and i bought  a expensive home  3bhk powai  25 cr   we are still partners and have been doing great so far and hopefully will continue to at multiple times in my career i had to fight with my own people  go against the wind to make my way  point of all this is  you reddit guys are tech adopters and are technically more advanced than the general public  there is a lot of people who are stuck at a job they hate but cant do shit about it either for family pressure or a dozen different reasons for you  i strongly recommend that in your free time develop a skill  mostly in a area you enjoy doing   and use that skill to compliment your primary source of income once you are confident enough and have some numbers  revenue  to back it up  take a leap of faith and see where it takes   dont worry about failure  if you fail  getting a job is the easiest thing to do   i agree that the being a  entrepreneur is volatile and there is no security but so is everything else  just see how many people gets fired everymonth with no where to go and they all wonder if they could make something like that parents ko bus paise chaiye as long as they see you are making good enough   they will be fine sooner or later   my father inlaw loves to flaunt when i share my photos with a bmw and mom makes dozens of calls telling all relatives whenever she purchase something expensive  they just want to see you happy  its just

its not like a very good career choiceim a fresher and got placed from my college and working for around 2 months now  but wtf is peoples obsession is with this field? its not a field where you are earning a lot  or you are your own boss or even your job is respectful  even after 810 years when you become project manager you may earn 5060 lpa  but still youre not like rich like you can do whatever you want  youre still blind by office timing  its not like you can take a vacation whenever you want toalso  one of the important factors is that you health is gonna deteoriate  9 hours in front of computer  and 3 hours in traffic for 5 days a week and wait for weekends to complete your sleepalso  if technology changes and you dont know that or do not learn the technology  your career takes a hit i just dont get it  the obsession behind the computer science field  why parents put this on their children? and how can they be proud of this? like what are you proud of  that your child is sitting in front of computer for 9 hours  and work like a slave?,ThrowaWayIdkIffy, it might not be what interests you but all things included  it is a better job than nearly everything else out there right after graduation in most jobs  engineering or otherwise   you have to sit in front of the computer for 9 hours and you cannot take a vacation when you want and you dont even come close to earning what a software engineer earns it is also the one field where you can get jobs right out of college you can say about doctors but not everyone has the memorization capacity  dedication and the amount of time and money required to be onethe only other alternatives are having a business or working as a freelancer on a contract basis in the first  you are your own boss and can take vacations but end up worrying about the business 24 7 also  you need substantial capital to start one and most startups fail the second option of freelancer is a very unstable oneindian parents are most concerned about job stability and finding a suitable wedding match  in both of which software engineering takes a prime spot  unless you have an mba of course  hey one doubt i became project manager but did not get the 5060lpa kahan complaint karoon? i hear what you are saying i work around technology  and the completely temporary nature of the skills  and how often you have to start all over and learn allnew skills and technology makes me really stressed i want my kids to understand a bit about tech  but i dont know that i want them to do it as a career assuming op is right  and hes fucking not  professions where earning more than 5060 lpa is possible after 810 years are1 ca2 politician  not sure legally though 3 own business4 actor  at least tv show lead 5 doctor6 cricketthere maybe more  but lets look at these first now compare the contacts  influence  money  luck and most importantly  time required to do moderately well in any of these fields  as compared to engineeringhence confirmed  op trying to be edgy its not a field where you are earning a lot  wrong maybe youre not earning enough your compensation depends on your negotiation skills and your technical skillsyou are not your own boss in which job you are your boss when youre fresher?your not job is respectful  wrong maybe your job is not respectful  dont project your own on others after 810 years when you become project manager you may earn 5060 lpai dont know if people earn this much if they become pm you may earn 5060 lpa but still youre not like rich like you can do whatever you want  wrong  youve poor money management and investment skills youre still blind by office timingwrong you work for shitty company its not like you can take a vacation whenever you want towrong you work for shitty company also  one of the important factors is that you health is gonna deteoriatewrong thats for every job if you dont know how to take care of yourself9 hours in front of computerwrong 3 hours in traffic wrong not every city is bangalore even in bangalore not everyone spends 3 hours in traffic wait for weekends to complete your sleepwrong  poor time management skill on your part also  if technology changes and you dont know that or do not learn the technology  wrong  fundamentals always remain the sameyour career takes a hit i just dont get ityes  if you werent good at fundamentals the obsession behind the computer science field  why parents put this on their children?maybe your parents did  not everyones parents are same as yours and how can they be proud of this?ask your parentsthat your child is sitting in front of computer for 9 hours  and work like a slave?dont sit in front of your computer for 9 hours then and dont work like a slave have some self respect so  what is a good career choice? i am an engineer too got my degree from one of the best engineering college in indiai have been working hard for last 5 years now i can buy jio net pack without asking money from family this is how success looks like fuck that i wish id made an effort in school and landed up an engineer the leastresistant path to success if you wanna hit certain milestones in life  financial   engineering is the quickest engineering has provided a better platform for us middle class folks to have a secure  settled life which is an aspiration for most of the middle class because we have no scope for apprenticeship education like plumbers electricians these professions are looked down upon we indians despise those who work with their hands   blue collar jobs  as a result only two professional lines are open since engineering is a cheaper degree    4 years 5 lacs as opposed to mbbs  1 year  15 lacs  most students opt for it lol its an excellent career option but then  you need to be competent and competitive one of the things in india is that there is a natural progression for your education school  plus2  engg mbbs degree  masters  if applicable the number of students who try to think out of this  and the number of parents who allow their wards to think out of this is pretty few there is also the factor of not many students getting a good mentor to get a different direction or at least get enough knowledge about the other optionsin terms of the work  as someone said below  almost every profession nowadays demands that you spend time in front of a computer this is not applicable only if you are in the sales field  or a factory worker supervisor or really unskilled labor anywhere  where you are in an educated position or even at the managerial level in a factory  you will necessarily end up spending a lot of time in front of the computer doing a lot of documentation and reporting work at leasti think the essence is to get a job which interests and excites the mind  and in addition  try to get a good remuneration for the same  which can support yourself  your family and whoever is required along with the demonization of engineering and stem studies is incredible engineering is hard and good jobs in india are scarce the main problem is  not everyone can be a good engineer then when people are not capable of doing good engineering  they despise itdoes not mean engineering jobs are bad perhaps you are in a bad company or in a bad job in a good company or both if dont have have attitude or interest or both for engineering  quit right way and do a mba mba jobs require more soft skills than hard skills  so you can bull shit away even if you are not interested the fact that you think of becoming a project manager in 8 years just as you have started your career shows you have no interest in the fun part of engineering so i think it is much better you train for project management with a mba but if you think engineering is fun or you have the aptitude for it  then sky is the limit immigration has been never so easier and there are also great companies in india depending on your interest if you are looking for just money you are better of selling soaps and chocolates in a fcmgthe typical it companies even after their worst working conditions offer much better than other industries and a good possibility to immigrate or to find a great indian company to help find a satisfying job please stop demotivating others with such rants problem with 2 months of work ex  people with 810 years of work ex make 5060 lakhsunless 8 year work ex guys are coming to your office in bmws audis  youre in for another reality check soon 5060 lpm in 10 years sure i will like to smoke whatever it is you are smoking  shitting on it is the new fad amongst millennials like shitting on chetan baghat it is not a very good career choice? wow what else is? like u serpantsociety told  most aspects of your questions is wrong it is hugely responsible for providing parity to the middle classes of semiurban and rural india  and that is a fact earning 5060 lpa whilst working a 9 hour day job sounds pretty awesome to someone who grew up in middle class mediocrity i am sorry but our life experiences are pretty different from those with the privilege of being born in circumstances where money isnt important i need some help guys i currently have 3 options to choose from which one should i go for? if i am doing engineering from a teir1 2 college ? 1 mechanical engineering 2 civil engineering 3 computer engineering i am not passionate about either of those but i will do anyone of them without any problem as i can work hard and get a degree easily i just want a field which is safe for the future and guarantees a decent job with a decent salary which one should i prioritize first and the least? any advice is appreciated this post is ignorance at its finest engineering is a key profession for building an economy  from top to bottom when india was looking to modernize its infrastructure and economy  they need ed  a lot more engineers to do it they had 2 options  bring in engineers from outside  or train a bunch locally  which they chose to do while india has seen improvements across the board in infrastructure and economic growth  they have trained more engineers than they need and now have a bit of a glut of engineers with how supply and demand works  the average wage of those engineers has fallenthe us is seeing something similar in health care as the baby boomer generation dies off  the smaller number of gen xs arent filling up the hospitals and assisted living facilities that where built up for the boomers now those facilities are starting to close and we have a glut of doctors and nurses  so the wages for both are falling 5060lpa  some people earn that much in their entire career while doing much more strenuous physical labour  if youre earning that much you can in most places afford to live near your office drastically cutting down your commutation time    as for your health that depends on the individuals initiative and lifestyle    whether youre earning 0 or crores  theres always a risk of you losing everything  as you said in 810 years you might earn 5060lpa if one is talented and ready to keep on learning forever there is no limit plus it is slightly easier to get into this field,2019-08-28 18:04:05

manifestos,rahulthewall, it is ironical that these manifestos are so optimistic and ideal and yet each government since as far as i remember fails miserably no doubt  improvements were made but the pacing is so slow compared to the humongous problems  both social and economical that i feel hopeless whether i look at these parties at this stage  i am just wishing that these sanghis just go away i dont want another social evil devouring this country this brazen propaganda and shameful communalization must stop at all cost  we have to wait years when wellbeing of our countryman is the first and

amendmentthey seem unanimous  yet the bill wont pass or will it? im a first time voter and honestly this is a lot to take in i cant decide whom to vote for so  how do i go about doing a swot analysis  so to speak  that might help me take an informed and unbiased decision as to who deserves my vote? i really dont want to hit the nota   id rather sit at home then  edit  ill read both manifestos properly and use my own faculty of reasoning and common sense to decide thanks for the input folks thank you for this quality post i really like this apprenticeship point training of work force is seriously lacking in india  especially the trades like plumbers  electricians etc  removed  looks like the sangh got spooked by the congress manifesto  and the response was to hurriedly put a lot of big numbers together 25 lakh crore investment for agriculture and 100 lakh crore in infrastrcture in 5 years  just to name two big items on the listthis might be ok if not for the irony of the sangh

thanks op  deleted  to those of you saying 33 reservation in parliament will lead to proxy women being installed on behalf of their make counterparts this was the same argument given when panchayats were mandated to reserve one seat out of five for women this myth has been debunked only in a marginal percentage do women act as proxies  otherwise theyre always rational autonomous agents  as much as allowed by the party whip  this is a fantastic bill and extremely necessary for all the underrepresented women of our country can anyone please explain what is combating left wing extremism in the bjp manifesto is ?also why it didnt say much anything about right wing extremism when we have seen visible growth in past couple years ?  instututions  congress promises to amend the antidefection law

says it will make the supreme court into a constitutional court  but doesnt the supreme court use the constitution already for its verdicts? here i can see most of the people are appreciative of the congress manifesto as being socially progressive never would have imagined something like this 5 years back but many have shown their concern regarding the funding of the nyay scheme i want this scheme to work i just hope congress gets the funds by taxing the hnis  like what is being proposed by aoc in the us  70 tax on the 10 millionth dollar i dont know if congress govt can pull this off

Politics,the real loser in indias errupting islamaphobia caste politics,85,g76o5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g76o5f/the_real_loser_in_indias_errupting_islamaphobia/,53,tldr my  unqualified  opinion is that dalit political movement has seen the most erosion in the antimuslim appraoch the government has championednote this post is for discussion if you have nothing but belligerent responses that add nothing to the conversation i will report you if you only have worn out  down over a thousand times arguments of being caste blind  having merit and anti reservation nonsense  i will be ignoring you now that ive gotten that out of the way  lets talkthe anti muslim sentiment grows stronger even in lockdown  with the hindu right finding more ways to demonize muslims everyday i didnt think it could be possible  but every day it seems they have a new angle of attack and such it has been since day 1 ie the day the 2014 elections results came out when the muslim techie was murdered by a hindu mob and that mosque attack happened  im forgetting where the very day of the results modi hadnt even taken up pmship that day so to begin  antimuslim rhetoric creates a unified hindu identity this is something that bjp has long worked for and was one of the goals of vhp  hm and rss since their inception  create a hindu identity that trumps caste indentity so that the caste status quo is maintained while killing any caste discourse now  im muslim and i have no intention of blaming dalits for the victory of bjp dalits  much like muslims  have been promised much by politicians purporting to be their champions but delivery has been less than spectacular lalus first term  maywatis first full term withstanding  no government has been able to delivery upon their promises to their dalit and obc voter very much so yes  i do not blame these communities for voting outside their champions  for fracturing the community vote but the fact remains that modis government has done spectacular work for the backward communities  barring muslims  we in urban areas scoff at the modi governments but their work for the financially weak and socially disadvantaged has been phenomenal from being called congress + cow it has been jokingly called prakash karat + cow such is the success of modis socialist policies that i have to begrudgingly accept it as the unequivocal truthbut coming to the matter at hand  obc representation in parliament has been dropping and sarvana ie upper caste repesentation is increasing now  dalits have reserved seats so while their count can not decrease  but this seat reservation is working against them im going to copy paste directly from an article here to explain this not a single constituency in india has more than 50 per cent dalit population  which means its always the nondalits who decide the fate of dalit candidates in reserved constituencies a vocal or assertive dalit leader has the least chance of winning from such seats to be reelected  a dalit mp must be careful not to antagonise the nondalits  and one way of ensuring this is by remaining silent in parliament  https  theprintin opinion 17thloksabhalookssettoconfirmambedkarsfearsnovocaldalitsinparliament 232383  note that balasaheb knew this would happen which is why he proposed that non dalits not be given a vote on reserved seats i am very much with him on thisso who is the loser here? mayawati has lost her base there can be no doubt about it the bsp+sp combine failed because sp votes were transfered to bsp but the bsp vote was not why? because dalits find bjp a more attractive proposition than bsp  who else? lalu and mulayam have lost a significant base altho this could be attributed to multiple reasons it is also less significant because obc leaders are many dalit leaders are few while chandrashekar raavan azad has made a great big splash  he is being kept under hold by the government almost since day 1 he has the appeal to be a mass leader and present a large potential threat to the status quo but he has been muzzled and jailed as often as was possible ultimately even the news cycles focus on muslim  and the caste conflicts happeneing everyday take a backseat  all the while forgetting that 85 of indian muslims are lower caste muslims here too  the muslim identity has trumped the caste identity and they are doubly the losers here considering that most muslim victim to islamaphobic attack tend to be the under privileged and of backward castethis is all by design  mind you the idea here is the same i mentioned earlier maintain caste status quo and the cost of caste identity and its workingnote that modi himself never speaks about caste despite being an obc he never mentions caste struggles and his own caste related experiences so his being obc does not bring more visibility to the problems of the oppressed castesreading material why dalits voted for the bjp  http  wwwindiaseminarcom 2019 720

not have any proof for or against this claim i am not an expert and am only summarizing what ive been reading from multiple news sources to date,HairLikeWinterFire, i understand everything you say except  but the fact remains that modis government has done spectacular work for the backward communities  barring muslims  we in urban areas scoff at the modi governments but their work for the financially weak and socially disadvantaged has been phenomenal from being called congress + cow it has been jokingly called prakash karat + cow such is the success of modis socialist policies that i have to begrudgingly accept it as the unequivocal truthwhat exactly are these policies? real problem is fake news most people arent smart enough to check facts by themselves i dont agree with the government uplifting backward classes and hence getting the votes part most of the policies  as already mentioned by others  predate this government furthermore  most of them are either pure disaster demo   mismanaged policies with potential gst   or did very little compared to how hyped up they were swaccha bharat  ujjawala  mnrega  beti bachao beti padao and the likes existed even in upa era  and were better funded than nowpoverty literally increased under modi  so did unemployment  and income inequality i should remind you that upa under manmohan uplifted record number of people after poverty in a decade  a record only second to china  farmers too  which constitute most of the backward people in india did far better under manmohan whats getting them vote is organised hatred they spread online indian people are gullible  and bjp were quick to capitalise on that people dont question the policies because they dont see the government as the problem  the media and the it cell have given people other enemies to blame in trying times muslims  congress and pakistan i should add  if you think upper castes think any better of the backward ones now  youre wrong nobodys enlightened  they just have a bigger enemy for now  if hypothetically  muslims were removed  the caste system will reach its former glory in no time i think for a long time in this country  there was a belief that the 15 muslims have a veto on who rules india in bjp circles i think there is a quote by balbir punj  former bjp mp saying the same the thing is that although as you say 85 of indian muslims are backward classes  the whole community itself was almost a single monolith when it came to voting preferences coming to some specific parties  say mulayam singh as the family becomes powerful  it looses focus and becomes a yadav party and all other obcs leave same for mayawati as she becomes all powerful  jatavs become powerful all others leave bjp  has in fact given tickets to the non yadav obcs and non jatav dalits in a significant number what bjp has done at the same time is create the most loyal caste base india has seen upper caste hindus they will vote bjp because they are scared of everyone else the opposition is not without blame for this when you constantly 24 7 call bjp a hindu party screaming at the top of your lungs  you are literally begging the hindus to vote bjpconclusion i dont think the caste politics is dying its just that its been played in a different way which seems more efficient ps  this is just a discussion do not take anything too seriously pleasantly surprised to see a post like this identifying that a majority of muslims are indeed erstwhile so called lower caste pedigree goes to strengthen my view that there arent really religions in india but castes  castes and castes that out of the way  the lower castes are  by design  kept under educated and under represented that very few realise theyre being used example https

denotes a caste and as opposed to an agrahaara which are usually a brahmin stronghold  the ak colonies are typically a stronghold of a particular low caste often reflecting the gross neglect over time as well these places  and others like it  have always had high unemployment all of this is a complete package you know its extremely hard to get out of anyway  in these places the testosterone fuelled unemployed youth are usually up to no good given no support system and discrimination outside and all back then they were used by the powerful as henchmen or for other dirty work now theyre still used by the powerful but the new powerful are all consolidating under the hindutva label the caste system is so uniquely ubiquitous in everyday life that the privileged bubble inhabitants cant even begin to fathom the world building that invoked if it all were presented as a novelthere are some unique castes  typically the erstwhile landowner class whove since graduated to owning large institutions  businesses and so on you know  grown up  productive stuff i have so much awe for how they look after their own and the sort of support system theyve developed for themselves which allows even for the underperformer amongst them to achieve something in life that he or she may feel proud ofthis almost never happens in the case of a lower caste disadvantaged person the rare ones who do happen to break out of it  if they were lucky enough to get some sort of support in the form of reservations _and_ familial  financial support and have the fortitude to survive the education system without being discriminated against they still face an uphill struggle wherever they end up working at more so if its a government workplace if they excel and do better than their peers theyre subject to allegations of having cheated and get corruption cases filed against them and after having to face all of this shit in their career are left with little to no wherewithal to be what they wish they had when they were young  a mentor  godfather or a role model to their own kind just like in the other powerful castes  ahem  communities and thats where the current _shaaka_s are capitalising on catching them young keeping them dumb not letting them rise making them hate each other and the muslims whore no different than they are driving away the missionaries who come with an education package a core feature of a hierarchy is that it is designed to always make anyone whos not at the very top nor at the very bottom to have someone to feel superior to and those at the lower ladders are at a double whammy position where theyre not enlightened enough to realise the harm theyre doing unto themselves by being part of some of the heinous crimes you hear of in places like tnanyway  its a shit show im envious that a majority of the caste denying elitists here dont have to see or imagine any of this and live their grand privileged lives envying that one sc guy who drove a bmw no political party every stands for them ka has had exceptional leaders from such castes for decades and theyre _never_ allowed to rise up its by design nobody can break out of it your analysis is quite correct   and the reason islamophobia is growing because many lower caste ar getting educated and thanks to propaganda they are likely to see islam more of a threat compared to brahminism a small example of how manusmriti ideology has even engulfed dalitsi happened to meet one of my batchmate who used to be a torched bearer of ambedkarism in our university   we both are dalits i was shocked to see idols of gods and the blatant karmkand things in his house which he used to vehemently opposei just asked him that what happened to you in all this years his reply was  ye buddhism jai bhim wagerah mein maaza nahi hain   kya milta hai buddhist banke  enjoyement apne hindu religion mein hi hain  i got so many things when i started following hindu religion jai bhim banenege toh koi bhi festival nahi hain  kya matlab uskai just told him that your job  degree is only because several decades back a man fought for it with the establishment  if not for him you would be  sewering in a gutter and doing what you are supposed to domany backward castes which have become affluent due to capitalism post 1990s are more hindus and more casteist than the brahmins   like yadavs   gujjars  marathas who are more indulged in caste based atrocities compared to the brahmins  i think you make valid points regarding  a  why bjp has gained the reserved seats  and  b  caste politics has been overshadowed by the unifying hatred against the muslimswe all probably agree with u android5511 that the reason for  b  is not so much the effective implementation of welfare schemes but the successful deployment of polarising techniques by bjp and its media cohorts that said i find their optimism that modilahar might wane slightly misplaced for three reasons  i  there is no indication that these polarising techniques have lost their efficiency   ii  as the present pandemic has given the center sweeping powers  regular administrative functions and even botched operations are now going to be touted as modis achievements  and  iii  the voting behaviour in state elections can be the opposite in central elections  case in point jharkhand which they refer toanother shortcoming which i find in the print commentariat as they try to understand why dalits vote for bjp is the shallowness of their analyses best exemplified by dilip mondals article that you linked  they fail to answer why is it that dalit voters  especially in urban areas  dont rally behind radical dalit leaders it would require a much lengthier writeup  but i suspect that it is the lure of savarna ethic and the success of capitalism which they are led into believing  owing to the constant media propaganda and the ineptitude of parliamentary left in india please note that i am not saying the savarna ethic is worth emulating or that capitalism is actually successful  quite the opposite i would say but such is the hegemonising power that the cultural elite have  a point noted by gramsci and successive othersthe savarna ethic is a selfreplicating one  a virus one can see that many obcs and many dalits become strident defenders of brahmanism once they acquire a certain degree of social mobility led into thinking that their emancipation is because of the savarna ethic  and not despite of it  many try to abnegate their dalit identity itself the same can be said about capitalism  it is the lure of this heady cocktail of baniya capitalism that fuels india and shapes dalit politics  outside the safe spaces of universities  today in such a context  it is difficult for a bahujan combine to have any real political teeth  though not impossible to begin with  such a possibility requires a theoretical agreement between the political actors,2020-04-25 00:51:21
Politics,a polite request to all indians here,401,g2ct57,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g2ct57/a_polite_request_to_all_indians_here/,82,i dont know if it is the same situation in other countries  but in india  i have seen a lot of organisations which have very toxic environmentsthere are offices where senior managers harass   shout at juniors  there are colleges where senior students rag juniors  there are school teachers who make fun of students who are not so good at studies and so onin many of the cases  i have seen that seniors harass juniors only because they were themselves harassed in the past by their own seniors many managers pick up the habit of shouting at juniors because they were shouted at too  when they were juniors do you see the problem here?  this cycle is never going to stop one able person will harass another  this person will then harass someone else  and this will keep continuingso here is my request  break the chain try to be polite to people  especially juniors around you  try not to vent out your frustration on your maid when you shout on her  she may not reply you  but she is definitely going to shout at someone else that day to vent out her frustration  perhaps she might shout at her kids  this will slowly start to have impact and i am hopeful people will get healthier work environments remember that indians are very low in the happiness index list  and with small efforts from our side  we can improve,aaluinsonaout, our society thrives on abuse of power we let too many idiots and abusers propagate their views with no societal checksif you are polite and calm people will say yeh tho chutiya hai and fuck about i asked a university functionary  leading private university in manipal  udupi  should be obvious now   for a laptop that was part of the tuition fees  two months after my programme started got a lot of flack for speaking up were being systematically trained to closet our thoughts will never happen because this atmosphere rarely changes at home that is where this habit is learned and festered your default indian cultural teaching is respect your elders  the no matter what is left unsaid  that really bad  if i was shouted at by my manager i should think how bad it feels and shouldnt do it when i become manger   i dont know why people become their manager who starts shouting at other just cz they were shouted ati have been a team lead and a manager  i can honesty say i have always i have treated  my teammates how i wanted be treated by my seniors and always supported them and employees are not slaves   you only pay them for the work they do for you and u dont own them  i have seen a guy who was acting manager who was shouting at in his friends company   complaining about being shouted at by his manager  where he actually worked for salary  the hypocrisy thats indeed the case most of the timesa lot of millennials and younger folk do indeed treat folks younger than us  folks in retail jobs  traditionally low profile jobs  like security  maids  janitorial staff  with more respect than our parents did  theres always the odd argument  disagreement  but its rarely based on class and statusmost of the folks who are bosses  reporting managers  senior staff do consider work life balance  mental health  many such factors as wellhopefully the trend continues  we do indeed evolve to a better social atmosphere than one  from the years gone by never understood the ragging culture no matter how small or insignificant the task is  it is not required to develop camaraderie ive never been a part of it  and will never be a part of it if i want to get the juniors to feel at home  ill invite them to a dnd session or some pubg csgo and chill why does this ragging bullshit happen in this country bastards who studied at the institution for extra years think they have some sort of authority over others the notion of a pecking order is deeply ingrained in our culture   the uppercaste is higher up the pecking order than the lower caste   husband is higher up the pecking order than wife   boy children are higher up the pecking order than girl children   seniors  in office  in college  in cricket team  are higher up than juniors   etc  the person who is higher up is to be respected  and the person who is lower down should expect to be yelled at and illtreatedi believe that this is one of the major things about our cultural mindset that makes us fail to achieve our potential the indians who flee the country and achieve good things abroad  nobel laureates  global ceos  are the ones who are able to break free of this this is so needed in our societyi went to a medical school  in case you do not know the way seniors treat juniors at medical or dental institutions is horrifying to make matters worse  professors are aware of all the activities that happen around you were asked to complete assignments of seniors  run errands for them  entertain them  some girls would give in and date seniors to avoid being ragged  humiliated by others   if you date a senior  its basically like a shield  my friends and i would avoid cafeterias and libraries so as to not run into anybody you have to address every senior by sir or maam and wish them good morning or good evening each time you see them in the hallways there were repercussions if not followedanyway  when we got to the second year we were so done with being treated like shit by our seniors we decided to break the chain outta 100 from our class around 20 people were in and we did by the time we graduated  ragging had diminished as new batches came in and it was reported to us seniors if at all anyone attempted anything the juniors were no longer treated like slaves and people were genuinely helping each other out there was no fear and juniors could actually hang out at the common areasbut it wasnt all roses  we were highly criticised and also humiliated by our own batch mates  seniors and professors for being responsible for the lack of discipline  intimidation  in the institution we were told ragging and fear of seniors makes one respect them and it would give them a firm hand and authority till they graduate i always hated being made to work late night or attend late evening callsso when i became a manager  no more meetings or calls after 6pm  and any work left after 6pm is deferred to next daymy team is the worst performing team in the company apparently according to some qualitative parameters that my boss  director of firm  has in mindmy team gets least of bonuses  and slowest promotions  but at least we live a good 96 life woohoo i have a dream that one day this is so true and its necessary to remember to be like this no matter what you face from othersim a lead of a design team in an mnc we have multiple issues where someone in marketing makes unreasonable deadlines to their superiors and expect everyone else to take the burden of their mismanagement im very confident about my team  theyre highly qualified i often tell our marketing teams to not rely on making my team work overtime to fulfill their demandsmy colleagues often tell me its my fault for not yelling at my team to meet demands i get  but as youve mentioned  the cycle has to break  this picture captures what you are saying   https  miromediumcom max 600 1ji2noadihsomqziezbbs0gjpeg  a lot of people in this thread have already told you that this will never happenonce  i had to go to the us embassy in vancouver  bc to get a visa the passport photo id brought with me was deemed to not be recent enough  and i had to get in line at the embassys photo booth in front of me was an indian family  a mother  a father  and a kid who was about four they were taking their time at the booth  which i didnt mind at all since i was busy doing a crossword in the midst of their struggles with the booth software  the child started to squirm out of the grip of his father  and his father responded by telling him that he was going to get slapped  in hindi to tell you the truth  i was pretty shocked itd already been a long time since id heard such a crude threat of violence to enforce compliance  but then it all came back to me  this is just how indian people are  i thought  though of course im indian myself id lived in the us for so long id forgotten that violence  egoslinging  and negligent laziness are among the only problemsolving methods most indians are equipped with you only have to look at the recent lockdown policing stints to find proofluckily  ive managed to break this cycle for myself by going through a personal hell and coming out a better person on the other side i believe that that is the only way for people to truly change  if they go through _severe_ trauma due to their faults as if that wasnt enough  i think its important to be far from the environment that nurtured those personal faults in the first placeits too much to ask this of an entire population of billions celebrating aggressive behaviour is also one reason for increased toxicity when we consider an aggressive person as a hero everyone wants to be heros thus extending the chain here is a reason why speaking politely  atleast for now  will not get things done in indiai was applying for exemption from articleship from a professional institution in india  ca cs icwa  i followed the procedure  submitted the documents  called them up and told them and also followed up by email nothing then i wrote an email to the director citing delay i got a call from the office and the lady started blaming me that i am student and should behave myself i am from mumbai she was from delhi up  not sure from the tone  i spoke in the language that we use on the streets including expletives and threats my exemption was approved without any hassles in less than 48 hours after i yelled at her no adverse impact laterindia doesnt have a good work culture the so called work culture  at least in structure and productivity mapping  we see in software companies is because of the forced discipline from international companies on our own  we basically do whatever we want and call it procedure we are supposed to love our company because in india  employers usually dont fire us except for tata steel  not tcs   i know of no such companyeven in mncs  i remember a tamil manager  who had an unstated heirarchy of hiring  first tamilians  if no tamilian available  then anyone from south india if anyone not from south india made it  because he didnt have entire control  he wasnt rude or bad he just made sure all the plum positions  opportunities  meetings  rewards went to his tamil buddies how i know this? i am from south india and he hired me thinking that i also belong to his school of thought shortly after  i gave him a piece of my mind and his response was basically along the lines of elders must be respected as a default we consider all humans good people  this is the way it is suppose to be  however in reality this notion gets defeated i agree to a small extent that venting of frustration may come as across pent up anger and follows a cyclical pattern  however this is not always the case there is an inherent issue with us  we have air of superiority and this comes to us naturally because of our socio economic development and the experiences we face to a lot of extent upbringing and family atmosphere matters though is nice to assume all people are good and will do their bit to break the chain  changing ones attitudes is extremely difficult  i will go further and say not possible we need to work on improving the outlook from childhood  superiority should be replaced with solidarity and empathy at the same time  i would stress on the need of having stronger  accessible laws and provision to use for the people who face such abuse this for me is the first and foremost thing to be done more than often people dont speak up cause of fear and feel the system is skewed towards the victim while it is nice to give a second change to the lets call him her abuser  the first incident shouldnt be neglected albeit a private office setting or the maid in fact a comparison between the maid and what happens in a office is not correct in office its an open setting  with certain corporate provisions to call out these incidents if they get out of hand for a non unionised maid if part of her life to face the brunt of people who by luck of birth were born in a different family though as adults we need to take the responsibility of civil  just  non abusive behaviour the rules and provisions need to be strengthened to nip this behaviour at the bud in official or domestic setting as a social change we need to teach children at home equality and empathy trumps superiority the ripple effect should mirrored in schools and society at large any solution for the junior in this position whose manager is doing the same? upvotes from me let me just add as someone who lead 3 different teams at a company dont hold back to stupidity if someone is slacking around the clock for months and pretends like they are the best i dont want them handheld i want them either fired or lecturedi was nice to all the guys who did their duties  we still grab drinks coffee together 5 years after i left  but there were people around for years above and below me who didnt do anything and made it a habit to ruin my weekends and found ways to make me work overtime by passing the ball  at a certain point i snapped and gave them each a earful its also what lead me to leaving the company since their ass licking ensured they were safe for life some aholes downvoted this too,2020-04-17 00:27:46
Politics,pitting a community against a political party is fucking stupid,194,futac9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/futac9/pitting_a_community_against_a_political_party_is/,73,first of all let me start by saying it was stupid whatever some muslims did at nizamuddin and still are doing by staying hidden and not letting the authorities do their work efficiently but this rant is not just about this situation  it is about peoples ignorance and lack of knowledge  people dont understand what is propoganda  and they dont know there history either and they continue to pit up a communuty against a political party no bjp does not represent hindus all it represents are the hindu extremists  so when i say fuck bjp  it means  fuck the politicians who are making this country burn bjp is the only party who has reached new heights and depths of instigating people to turn on each other  and paint muslims as someone who are gonna attack hindus for no reason regardless of what people want  a political partys job is to maintain communal harmony in a democratic country what part of this people dont undertstand ? and why are dalits even supporting bjps assholes  they beat up dalits  discriminate against them  all bjp is trying to do is keep brahmin supremacy in this country everyone is crazy about religion  i say fuck religion  if you believe in a higher power that is cool i dont care but killing in the name of god  fuck nohad to get this off my chest  sorry  and thanks for reading if you made it to the endif you have any objections to what i have said  i can conversate or debate sanely but please stop the craziness  use your brains i dont care what your parents  uncle aunties believe in  use your own brains otherwise india is not gonna stay a democratic country  and this is not even a baseless fact anymore  its all around us  we just close our eyes to look around,chillinvillain122, our country is just too far in at the moment and theres no turning back now  our best hope is to believe that we make it to the other side without taking too much damagesomething much worse than the 2002 riots is ahead of us  it always was but now with the covid19 situation acting as a catalyst we are going to reach there sooner a couple of points1 i think india is inherently fragile bjp has not invented something  they are just leveraging the pre existing fault lines another thing is that there are so many people who vote for bjp because they are so fed up with the opposition i dont know exactly but rahul gandhi wouldnt get a lot of crowd in my tiny village 2 a substantial part of this country do not care about democracy people dont like having to make difficult decisionsdont consider this as a debate to your points  just my pov bjp stands for divisive politics in a state where the minority is a majority they play the outsider insider politics a place where the majority is the majority the play the caste wala card bjp is being run like an efficient political business so i dont see when and how it can be stopped if you kill in the name of religion  your god has already forsaken you            unknown though i appreciate what you are saying  majority of the people are just too naive and uneducated to understand what you are sayinglack of education and awareness is the root cause of divisive politics based off of religion your actions show your real motives  not your words going by your logic  there is no real reason muslim women should vote for congress as they were the ones opposing triple talaq and it was bjp who made it into law in the us  you say chinese virus and people will call your a racist in india  you say corona jihad youre a nationalist and people say india will soon become a superpower my ass if you pay attention  india is becoming the next pakistan the only job of a political party is to stay in power no matter what they have to do for iti dont think bjp is at fault  the people of india are at fault fuck bjp fuck religious people dalits dream of becoming a mainstream hindu someday where they are treated equally  so they will do what they are told they forget that they will never be accepted as equal they are in for a rude awakening   and why are dalits even supporting bjps assholesbecause they dont understand how hinduism promotes brahminical supremacism  which implies oppression of people like them thats why they are  and their ancestors before them were  and their descendants will be  dalitsyou cant expect everyone to be as woke as ambedkar who understood how hinduism is oppressive to hindu lower castes the same people conveniently ignore the numerous hindu festivals the reason dalits support bjp is because the rss recruit them at a very young age rss targets the vulnerable as in the poor the poor mostly consists of sc st and as such the rss sink their claws into them at a very young age theyre brainwashed by the age they can make decisions on their own they are set in their own ways this isnt the case for all sc st some do luckily get awayhttps  youtube 51h4_wl4ah0  removed  absolutely agreed india is an authoritarian state bro lol  removed   still are doing by staying hiddenjust to clarify they are not hidden but stranded just like many people during the tirupati or the ones stuck in ahmedabad for which a special bus was arranged by tadipaar to send them to uttrakhand are you muslim op?,2020-04-05 02:28:28

Politics,how to educate indians about liberalism  right  left  center  and other political ideologies?,44,g7ml5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g7ml5m/how_to_educate_indians_about_liberalism_right/,13,i recently came across a facebook post by an acquaintance#x200b https  previewreddit p89mypkfsvu41png?width743formatpngautowebps0594ac38ebe1dfe162d78e38fe1c36e7b03a9a3bhes a top b school graduate  works in a firm with clients across the world and has traveled to more countries than i know the names ofi was left wondering why he added the word liberals in his observation to my small brain  liberalism is about freedom of thought the definition is  a liberal is a man who believes in liberty   from   https  platostanfordedu entries liberalism   https  platostanfordedu entries liberalism    how is someones love for freedom of thought considered to be antiindian  antinationalism  antitradition etc?the bigger question is why are so many well traveled  educated indians becoming so blatant in their use of political terms without any sense of what they mean? i often hear people use leftist as a derogatory term  but why? a government thats run by the left is usually more focused on delivering basic services to people  like health  education etc while the one run by the right is more focused on allowing private sector to operate everything in any modern society  both left and right ideas existthe person i mentioned thinks that usa is the capitalist mecca  but then why are trillions being printed to bail out corporations  and why are stimulus checks being handed out to the masses? is that not a leftist response to the crisis? most people in my circle have never read the definition  the literature of anything political  and their views and words sound as if coming from testosterone powered unruly teenagers rather than a mind with a sound intellectmy question is  what can be done to improve this situation? how to make people realize that left  right etc are terms with real meanings and should not be used out of context? how to make people see the good and bad on both sides?unless we educate people about different ideologies  well have a generation of people who became bigots  both left and right  due to ignorance and not malice thats disastrous for the nation ,Pleasant_Self, a lot of people have no idea what left right liberal conservative nationalist or centrist even mean in india  this jargon is picked up verbatim from the words used by the right wing supporters thats why the words commies leftists and lutyens is used to describe anyone who doesnt agree with them i had a discussion a few months back with a colleague who is an ardent supporter of the bjp and modi it had something to do about the freedom of speech and everytime she argued that this was being misused shed say leftie and liberal freely during a particular discussion she said these exact words  the government should just make all the rules and tell people what to do and people should listen or go to jail  thats the best solution i looked her dead in the eye and said you described communism in a nutshell she looked dumbfounded for a whole minute before another person piped in with left right centre  who cares theyre all the samethe most recent years have taught us that education in india at least is by no way a measure of peoples political brain space this is most likely because the millennial generation has been dissociated from it for a better part of our lives and weve become active in it over the last decade thanks to the abject polarisation a key point here op is that you cannot educate somebody who does not want to be educated people choose  especially in india  to be mislead and misinformed rather than face the reality of being corrected ive given up arguing and debating with the right wing also for the record liberalism doesnt only mean to believe in liberty and rights  because even conservative ideology believes in liberty and freedom liberalism is a more open minded view on religion  emancipation of women and sexuality conservative movements view this as an erosion of culture whereas far left movements view it as an abuse of freedom i think the misinformation against the left has roots in people equating the left with communism  in particular communism as applied in china  ussr etc people are not motivated enough to learn that these were the most haphazard application of the marxist ideology  rife with blatant misuse of power thats not to say that communism doesnt have its problems with being too idealistic but most people equate it with those  and thus perceive the left as evil a lot of people also equate the left with maoist terrorists and such a lot of individuals in the right do not understand that political views exist on a spectrum and all liberals  communists  and maoists are put in the same category  so to say certain right wing supporters also claim liberalism as a western islamic propoganda machine with the intent of erasing indian culture why? thats quite simple actually  basic social psychology theres a concept called ingroup and outgroup theory people who have similar views race caste etc are in the same ingroup  and those who have even slightly different views are the outgroup there is no inbetween people dont know what left wing ideology isthe usa is bailing corporations out  right wingthe usa bailing out its citizens  also right wing its not a welfare check its an economic stimulus check directly aimed at injecting cash into the economy which currently is taking a hitpeople really do not understand leftist lit which is crazy considering the relationship between india and the ussr i mean how many indians grew up reading mir publisher works? a common man isnt gonna read sep for one i think the problem is most people never develop the habit of reading longform articles their minds see walls of text and switch off writing is easier than drawing but reading is far more difficult than seeingthats why it cells with their oneline or cartoon panel simplifications succeed so well in educating adults with untruths and half truths turns out educating most adults is not that different from educating toddlers  they need big colourful pictures and cartoonsso  one approach is using cartoons  comic books and short visual stories explaining concepts with some mix of humour and seriousness for example  a cartoon like  this  https  imagesdailykoscom images 379031 story_image whatwouldrepublicanjesusdo1442781591_1_jpg?1489807108  or a  visual short  https  imgurcom gallery bcqrp  like this summarize the hypocrisy of some us republican policies visual short stories should be the kind we used to get in comics like tinkle and ack goal should be to educate and not brainwash the comics themselves should avoid biases and fallacies  and cover different traits of the spectrum on both sidesof course  bringing out a regular weekly or monthly political comic that tries to educate in english and major indian languages is no small effort probably requires dedicated fulltime employees the main problem is the media they are the ones who have propagated this idea of liberal  bad the media is controlled by an oligarchy and they get to decide what is being said and howits also a fault of the people who are lazy to a fault they gobble up anything and everything the media says without applying their mind and doing their own research the indian pubic is least bothered with dont research they are intellectually spoon fed since their childhood thanks to the great indian education system they have no concept of questioning the source of knowledge and just want to reinforce their ideological worldview dont take it to heart im sorry but right now its not a good time to publicly declare yourself as a liberal as the word had lost all meaning even though the word means being free thinking like you said with which i totally agree  in my opinion its far more effective to just ride out this nightmarish rw wave  the bigger question is why are so many well traveled  educated indians becoming so blatant in their use of political terms without any sense of what they mean?this is the fallout of identity politics the debate shifts to labels instead of issues the person i mentioned thinks that usa is the capitalist mecca  but then why are trillions being printed to bail out corporations  and why are stimulus checks being handed out to the masses? is that not a leftist response to the crisis?100 this is the actual decline of the us if the companies are supposed to be bailed out in every crisis  there needs to be a higher tax rate on them us is actually deviating from its longheld view of markets we are actually seeing the destruction of rome my question is  what can be done to improve this situation? how to make people realize that left  right etc are terms with real meanings and should not be used out of context? how to make people see the good and bad on both sides?dont focus on issues at hand every problem requires a different solution that solution might be left or right by someones definition i am personally of the opinion that ideological labels are useless outside of social science and political analysiswe need not educate people what these labels mean i dont prefer labels in general labels are only used to obfuscate arguments outside of social science and political analysis someone could largely align with progressive  socialist views  but still agree with conservatives on some other points then theres the difference between economic and social left and right the average person doesnt care  the average person only cares about basic civic amenitiespeople can have different views on different issues there is a spectrum of opinion and people lie in different places on this spectrum how about whatsapp post of 2 line definition of conservatism  liberalism  right wing  left wing and centersingle definition on a page no more than 4 line and with wikipedia source at the end?? the problem is people resort to and hold on to labels the only way out is to minimize the use of these labels most of them when they take a political leaning test would be surprised that they themselves are liberal socialist they only hate the words and not that ideology literally everyone i know calls me a leftistcommunistim libright,2020-04-25 16:53:40

she is living abroad  did she never shop in a pakistani shop  half the so called indian shops are run by pakistanis  at least here in europe  or interact with pakistanis abroad?i would understand if someone within india says that  because lets face it  with the current political atmosphere in india  that would not be surprising at all but living abroad and saying shit like this is she is a horrible person  deleted   here ya go  another thread it is a lost cause  https  npredditcom r india comments flmmps man_riding_motorcycle_beaten_up_in_maharashtras   i am in two minds about thisi do feel that we shouldnt in general dehumanize people it seems grossly unfair the wars and games between our ruling classes shouldnt destroy our humanity as individualsbut theres also this angle the members of a tribe  religion  nation  race  caste  ethnicity  etc  need to be aware that the tribes harmful actions towards others will exact a toll on them individually for instance  if members of caste a are especially casteist and or communal  then individuals from that group should feel the heat for it from others  even if the individual himself or herself may not be casteist or communal otherwise they will have that much less incentive fix their tribespeoplei have used this principle with respect to myself if i am hated because members of my tribe exhibit certain undesirable behaviors  then while i may not deserve it  i certainly should realize that the reaction is expected  natural  and even healthy  in a way it gives me an incentive to fix the harmful actions of my fellow tribespeople hating or punishing the members for the transgressions of their tribe is a normal strategy used in tribal calculus it may not be healthy individually or collectively to suppress this ancient instinct just like our instincts for revenge and sexual jealousy  it might exist for a reason r abcdesis if the government allow us    and that no one was coming for himha hed most likely be better off staying in china is that what they call trying humanism? brother you are preaching to the wrong crowd you need to post this to other hateful subs i mentioned that the one good thing that could come out of this virus would be a true and total support for fellowmen the problem with these things is that theyre usually expected to only go one way its only indians who are expected to bend over backwards and consider humanity and finer human values  pakistanis are never expected to return the gesture support for fellow men would also require the pakistanis to stop sponsoring the terrorists who kill indian civilians at this point terrorists have killed more indians than covid19 has  though i expect that equation may change in a few weeks  and yet pakistan continues to actively support terroriststhings have gotten to a point where despite being on the fatf grey list  which hurts their economy  they continue to support it theyre willing to let their country burn if it means indians will die when you have that kind of hatred emanating from that side  you can expect it to be reciprocatedfwiw  id prefer for india to evacuate all students as long as the logistics allow it what do we do after that though is an open question will pakistan take back these students or simply dump them on india to treat quarantine? remember this is a nation that refused to accept the bodies of its own army men during kargil  and the army is basically the organization that runs the country its still morally the better option and so we should have done it  but lets not bring in all these ideas of support for fellow men which only ever go one way nice virtue signaling wrong sub my man i mean there is always this one dickwad in convos like these  pakistan isnt equipped to deal with this virus they arent equipped to deal with a viral fever they could all die and it would be a good thing if they were all wiped out yeh kaun bolta hain bhai?,2020-03-20 15:03:16

could have commanded the police or the armed forces but didnt the dms didnt do that or thats whats being said also  there was no formal request from aap what does aap have to say about it? im sure someone would have asked it of them thats not it what he did was deliberate his silence on genocide and granting permission to police against kanhayiahe was expected to be on ground to protest against the genocide  he didnt even held a press conference against itthis all was a message to gain more votes  he wants to expand and dont want to lose any votes he can score on  even if people who support bhagwa terrorism he made it clear that he is not against muslim genocide so that he can be more popularhe is a snakehis primary motive is his political carrier  not what he projects  the idea of being anticorruption and righteous if not criticized he had no problem playing the caste politics  mai baniya hu mujhe vote do his rajya sabha nomination are also shady it was pretty clear he sold rs seat for money like bsp does   also they both share same caste as kejriwal opinion   arvind kejriwal sold rajya sabha seats for money mayank gandhi  https  wwwnews18com news opinion opinionarvindkejriwalsoldrajyasabhaseatsformoneymayankgandhi1621639html  in aap settling for 2 guptas for rajya sabha  a debt and thank you note  https  wwwndtvcom indianews inaapsettlingfor2guptasforrajyasabhaadebtandthankyounote1796021 and above all we should not forget why people left aap on first place  there is no aap its ak  the party itself is pretty antidemocratic   arvind kejriwal does not allow anyone to come forward other than him  their is no ideology just ak himselfbut my problem is something bigger than that  my problem is the fact that indians no matter their political inclination they all tend to be bhakts just like sanghies blindly support narendra bjp we have their counter part here too who are blind bhakts of ak we should be neutral and chose whatever is best  even if you vote for them you should not become bhakt for them throughout the history of india indians have done this and it always result into disaster  we should follow our own moral compass not our fhrer at the end of the day  their priority is keeping the power and money everything else is secondary or for the show woeful response to the delhi communal violence reflects the limit of its welfare politicsthe reason communal violence is propagated on the population by a political party is primary due to lack of proper educationaap is focusing on providing proper education the only thing aap could of had done differently was aap mlas going to the streets and sitting right in the middle of the road where the riots was happening and you know what would of had happened to them if they did that  they would of been killed on the spot the reason for this is that the riots were started by men brought in from up bjp learned from the gujarat riots not to use locals they would of been killed the same way congress ex mp ehsan jafri was murdered in 2002 gujarat riots https  wwwthehinducom news national otherstates thefivemenwhokilledehsanjafri article14427953ecethe five accused who have been convicted for lynching the former mp are yogendrasinh shekhawat  jayesh jingar  krishnakumar  jayesh parmar and naran tank all of them were sentenced to life impriosnment for 14 years true  ak didnt show courage during the riots  but i dont think he could have controlled them without the police the most he could have done is some noise aap has 62 mlaswe know the police are not under their control  but all of those 62 have got at least 10 security guardsif they all would have gone together with their protection force on the day of events  at least those 620 would have protected few lives assuming the police guards feel ashamed in front of the minister to actbut all of those 62 chose to sit and enjoy twitter mob of both the sides was out their in numbersits was communal frenzy what can aap will do if riots continued for 3 days in a national capital means police stand downed lets be honest kapil mishra is not a big leader to go this far unless he had the blessings of amit shah more and more anti caa protests are taking place and riots is to instill fear in em thats why all that happened and police dont have the orders to stop it what has happened is that bjp  by crying about identity politics the loudest  has made sure all other parties are now shy to be seen as engaging in identity politics in this way they have made sure that all parties have ceded ground to them and they can now play identity politics themselves to their hearts content if a party can win 54 of the votes in a city  it has the political capital to intervene who knows  maybe a big supporter backed intervention and a call for peace movement could have become a launchpad for kejri on the national scene again one possibility is that aap was not

why do you allow yourself to be governed poorly  say ? or  are you satisfied?,kammra, one  i dont want to go to jail two  a good proportion of dumb people means that my politics have to be dumb too  and something that will appeal to dumb minds my dumb logic has to be right this is very difficult  and only truly dumb politicians or truly smart politicians can pull this off the acting level required is just too muchpolitics is too much of a commitment in a developing country real smart  committed idealistic people were once in politics most of us better educated  more intelligent people today are too practical to waste our lives in something where we are likely to fail in our area there are a lot of educated middle class people who stood for elections  both local and national level no one voted for them these were people who are visible in local drives like trash cleaning  vaccination drives and other sundry matters but no one votes for them it is either bjp or congress or some other established party so its no use unless you have a lot of money to blow in deposit i am not ready to sell my morality to the highest bidder yet the ias is an infinitely better option if you want the country to change they are the ones who implement the policy in the first place rather than the politicians who are just there to sign if anyones name is arnab please dont answer this question check out ops username edit  s what is preventing you from joining politics? as for me  im just part of the pipeline that everyone goes through a sheep  not a leader i follow or remain ignorant its true that i am sorely disappointed by the state of affairs and want things to change but that doesnt mean i would want to join politics i can rather become an occasional activist and focus on my original passion joining politics needs a lot of commitment and thus time  which would just lead me to stray from my actual passion so yeah  occasional activism works better for me i am an introvert i cant go around campaigning nor do i have funds it needs even give a decent fight and i cant go around begging for funds too but if i do get elected  say through rs  i would be willing to join politics and do the job i think its not a level field with all the goons currently present unless you have backing of some political group  which defeats the purpose   it is nearly impossible for a middle class guy to risk my life including the life of my family while i know risks and can understand we need people who can work for common people and poor  it wont go unnoticed by the corrupt that i will be exposing a lot of their shit on the way my political opinions are illegal a few crores  deleted   removed  i was a member and still support a small party called loksatta they contested mla elections in 2013 and bengaluru municipal elections in 2015 our candidates always came third or lower  behind bjp and congress  it was disheartening we put in money from our own pockets campaigned on the issues that matter and yet  i saw first hand  how the socalled educated voters still view elections with a communal mind  religion and caste  i saw bjp and congress workers openly bribing families in slums thats when i realized its hard delhi and aaps victory was an exception  not the norm india will remain a third world country because much of its people vote based on all the wrong priorities the day voters hold leaders accountable for real important matters will be the day parties like aap or loksatta gain nationwide acceptance but sadly i do not see that happening anytime soon 1 most elections are determined by campaign expenditure 2 people dont have the time  knowledge  awareness or critical thinking to assess their options 3 politics has always been dirty and there is a very real chance of losing life and limb if you flip off the local mafia which is often also the local politicians family#x200b you can still donate to the candidate you favour  if not in money you can volunteer  join their campaign and use your skills to help them win also  i am useless i am honest and cannot dupe people i like being alive i am some one who believe that an individual has to think about his own development and making himself strong financially mentally etc while not at all obstructing the development of fellow individuals  all these individuals make up the country and inturn mean that country will develop along with them  it is such a development where we no longer need any leader  thus i stay away from politics  i know it sound unreal and cringy  but that is what i think  have you joined politics?if not  what prevents you from joining? iam not a yes person  politics requires yes people i need a godfather to enter in politics just because one is disappointed with something  it doesnt warrant participation if you arent happy with a meal  you dont try to become the chef you can complain and try to set things right or you just go where you find better food there are millions who are sick of this country  not all of them are going to join politics and just joining politics will in no way give matters into your own hands im not allowing myself to be governed poorly because i exercised my right and voted for whom i believed in  the problem is that person party didnt win which is beyond my control,2020-02-07 17:40:35

it doesnt matter whether a person is rich or poor  people will still discriminate learning the name of an individual this is a controversial topic  but how about adding some sections of the general class to the reservation? ive seen people belonging to the general class slog it out while people for the reserved class have taken all benefit availed to themthey are not only well off  but they are literally exploiting the system the reservation systrm wws introduced to even out the field  but people are now exploiting the systemthe government should definetly revise list of reserved categories the total reservation in some states is up to like 78 it doesnt make any sense do it for surebut our neighbours  aunty uncle and professionals still askoh mr x uske aagekumaruske aageaacha cashte kya hai tumhari one of the problems of the current reservation system is that even within the reserved communities  certain sections only are getting benefits and they collectively deny these benefits to the actual people for whom the reservation is meant in the first placefor example  i know of several people of the sc and other reserved communities who are pretty well off  and still they end up using the reservation system because of many people like them  the people in their communities who are not at an advantageous position like them are being denied potential benefitsthe best way going forward in this situation would be to implement something on the lines of the noncreamy layer  ncl  in all the present day reserved communties funny that most upper class folks  either wants to add poor upper class folks to reservation or get rid of it altogetherfor every i have seen rich sc st kid taking benefit  there are 100x more case of middle rich lower caste people getting discriminated because of their castetry buying a property or  even renting in the upper class locality being a lower class in gujarat  guess same is the same in small towns elsewhere too  or try starting a restaurant in small town where people know you are from lower caste and see how many would visit?its very easy to comment on something you havent gone through a bench comprising of the sanghi arun mishra not surprised not a single lower caste on the bench this upper caste paternalistic attitude of we know whats best for you lower castes is the fundament issue plaguing caste politics in india all the way back to the poona pact and not gonna change anytime soon let me propose a solution which is fair to everyone reservation system was built so that we can all leave the caste system behind and be equal citizens it was supposed to be demolished by now and would have if caste system was obliterated since we have proved that we  as indians  are very much attached to the caste  let me propose a solution based on population let us pick up 2010 census data and give each category caste religion reservation as per their percentage of indias population 100 reservation so say if a category is 10 of indias population  give them 10 reservation wherever applicable everyone gets seats of their own category there will be no general category everyone will compete with their own casteagree that this looks like a pretty draconian solution but the caste system is draconian as well this is the best solution we are yet evolved to deservethere are several demerits of this approach eg this will work to only increase rift between castes etc but seems like people want only fair this is fair views? slow clap  s reservation hata do yaar  college admission mai time jo lag gaye the woh abhi tak yaad hai discrimination to remove discrimination thats reservation for you i think it would be very difficult to get data to establish this  sc judges are now just penning their fantasies in the garb of judgements most deprived person should get the job education seat  eg if there are two candidates  ones  father is a rickshaw puller  anothers father is a clerk  the rickshaw pullers son should get the seat job there should be provision of teaching lessons for so called forward cast because reserved category might become educated but the one who create more nuisance will always be there how about this? ignore the caste give reservation to poor  increase the imprisonment and penalties for caste discrimination crimes hard agree about damn time if done logically and transparently  this can be an extremely good move why dont we use aadhaar and census data for this? i was not in favor of collecting data for aadhaar but now when it has been collected already  we should make use of it for things like this aadhar data can be positively put in use for so many things this being one of them,2020-04-23 17:16:38

Politics,why the supreme courts verdict on sc st quotas has created a political storm   it has upheld the states powers to deny reservations to scheduled caste and scheduled tribe communities,108,f1o839,https://scroll.in/article/952687/why-the-supreme-courts-verdict-on-sc-st-quotas-has-created-a-political-storm,47,nan,rahulthewall, muslims and reservation are two distractions used by indian elites to confuse people these two are blamed for all of indias problems and people are stupid enough to believe it honestly  as a dalit i sometimes wish let them remove reservation then let them explain to masses how 1 indians are getting 73 indian wealth within decade there will be riots in streets and true people responsible for indian poverty will be found out sizable dalit tribal population doesnt understand how system is rigged against them  they think reservation is making some difference these guys can finally wake up you have 225 reservation for 29 sc st in government jobs which are just 4 of total jobs and people think this is useful or something the main question we need to ask is where are the damn jobs ? i have said previously that scheduled castes and tribes are next on the list after muslimslooks like i was wrong theyre targeting everyone at the same time  just with a different approach the other problem is also the courts selective affirmation of the states discretionary powers for providing reservations when it comes to a decision not to provide reservations  the court feels the state has absolute discretion and need not collect data to justify this decision but when the state wants to provide quotas  the court brings in the concept of equality and places several restrictions that dilute the discretionary power of the state the 50 ceiling for quotas is an example of this restrictionthis alone is enough to show how the supreme court is disingenuous and biased as hell and their end goal isnt equality of any sorts first they stopped making it compulsory for promotion in government jobs and now will give only lower level jobs to reservationssecond they stopped compulsory arrest in sc st act and will give pree arrest anticipatory bail to the accusedthis is the destruction of the act itself bc reservation is not the government spooge to give its a bloody constitutional right get that modi shah i wish the govt does try fucking around with the reservations i truly pray that they somehow think that by making their stooges pass such judgements that they can alter the basic tenets of reservations and try curtailing it it will be the end of this govt period come on bjp rss try messing with reservations please you can do it show us how tough you are first moslems   now sc st   good job bjp judiciary  govt  golly what is with this government? talk to upper caste  and they believe bjp is shit and giving sc st everything talk to sc st  they say its upper caste partywho the fuck voted for these mfs? i believe reservations  should be based on economic conditions and not on castethe reason is many scs and sts have a high family income yet take advantage of reservationon the other hand there are many general candidates that have very low family income yet have no such advantagereservations if any  should be used to lift the distressed classes and not lift the already uplifted,2020-02-10 23:30:46

i remember a quote from a game which aptly describes your dilemma   it goes like this  friends  who want to remain friends  dont discuss religion or politicsbut  we need to draw a line somewhere  if your friend starts justifying premeditated  violence on innocent citizens  then its time to start evaluating your friendship welcome to my world buddy you are in the same boat as i my best friend has turned into a soft bhakt and justifies every action of the govt one way or the other he is one of the kindest man i know and about 80 of his friends are muslims and yet the cognitive dissonance persists the only difference between our situations is we do not post memes and articles in our common group we both know where the other stands politically and i call out on his bullshit if he open his mouth regarding the caa or nrc debacle but we keep it respectfulwe dont name call each other we have a mature conversation and usually never come to an agreement the only thing i ever said that was harsh was that hope he doesnt stand on the pavement while his muslim friends are being hauled into an uncertainty and shouting that they should get into the vans because the govt said so he kept quiet and never spoke about the caa issue with me ever again we meet now and talk about life in general keep politics minimal there is a tacit understanding that we value the friendship more than our political differences kanhaiya kumar actually raised this point in his recent speech at jnu modi is dividing families and friends first they ignore you  then they laugh at you  then they fight you  then you win distance yourself from these venomous snakes they saw it but the difference of opinion never affected our friendshipthats because youre a privileged moderate who prefers negative peace to positive justice politics always affects people you were just privileged enough to not care indian people dont know about the term opinion they are stupid and have a mentality of if your opinion is not same as mine  fuck you i was just saying today how this moment in time has brought out the true colours of so many people we know on one hand its shocking to see the hate and utter stupidity but on the other its heartening to see the good you need to decide whether youre okay being friends with these people they arent just people who have a difference in political opinions theyre straight up hatemongering  bloodthirsty  bigoted pieces of filth recently i have lost my good friend too he doesnt used to be like that  but he is acting differently he started saying that most of the muslim doesnt know what actually caa and started the crap then he said after explaining these thing to muslim dominated  community in bangalore everyone changed their mind and they are in support of caa a convenient story to dismiss ones view  i am sure he is using the whatsapp forward messages then i argued with him that caa itself is unconstitutional as you are discriminating on the basis of religion then he started saying this is very emotional matter to him  started crying about hindus in other country i said u could take the persecuted in your country regardless of religion or country then he said we cant take everyone as we have enough population so discarding few of them i had enough explaining him about this but he is not listening and asking me to change my mind if this is the case then they werent worthy friends to begin withi assume liberal germans lost a lot of friends to nazi politicsu know they stayed silent and what happened then?ss killed all liberal activists u r speaking up and not submitting to authority thats why modi is silent else he wud have impose 144 everywhere,2020-01-10 04:55:13

 deleted  d you do paint the bjp as siths man there are always two i didnt see a cow in this table where is the cow? seems plausible every megalomaniac thinks his subordinates are replaceable trump will not doubt will this coming election that too without any second in command of shah stature to modi  trumps mo of power wielding probably seems like heaven  surround yourself with nincompoops and do whatever you want because the public loves you yes  it makes total senseprobably why theres so much conflict between shah and doval both are doers but one is a no name government employee and the other is a well known and dangerous goon modi prefers people that do not have any personal political standingbut i dont quite believe it not just yet modi will still run to shah come up elections tf is this blinds and gossip bullshit amit shah was there in cabinet meetings saw atleast 34 photos of different meetings hes probably taking a break from being at forefront perhaps shah took responsibility for delhi wipeout and retreated into the shadows  s i hope  maybe even after a lot of years later  we get to watch a movie read a book with the actual dirt that went on inside bjps office during these years who do you guys think would write that book? provide the source please i think its not his thing shah will surface again when the time come but dont think modi is different than shah dont look at what someone says look at what they does remember kapdo se he pahchan me aa jata hai?

grad student from coimbature were the same age  however  shes getting a 2year gradaute degree from the same college here in america where im getting my bachelors from   heres some background information   1 shes going to make a lot more money than me it hurts my pride  american who was raised to take care of his family   but i can live with not being the primary bread winner 2 i understand that india has a lot of arranged marriages thats the culture  does not bother me however  what does bother me is 3 her sister and her mother  and a few friends know about me but she doesnt want other family to know because shes scared of how she thinks they will think about us  or something like that? she can never really give me a clear answer  but it seems like shes so scared for her extended family to know about us and thats where the problem lies     we are already talking about getting married however  because we are about to graduate  we are not able to stay where we are  because of money we are talking abotu getting engaged soon  but she has family in america that she can move in with  and i dont currently i also dont want to be in different parts of the country if we are planning on getting married soon     so  the help that i am requesting is  what can i do to help her understand how important it is for her to let that family that needs to know about us know  so that we can get things settled? if she wants to wait to tell extended family  thats fine i understand how different indian and american cultures are but  were planning on staying in the united states  she is wanting to marry an american is there a way for me to get her out of her shell of hiding behind indian culture and family politics and understand why it means to me  an american  to know what our future holds without being a complete asshole or jerk? i really love the girl  and do genuinely want to marry her  but the difference in cultures is a roadblock  and it is so frustrating sometimes if it wasnt so time sensative  i could wait  but we are out of time for me to be super super patient,dcm7734, every human being is different  so please take my generalized advice with a pinch of salttheres a strong division in indian society between what is public and what is private please know that these conceptions are not universal and do not overlap exactly with american ideas in many indian communities  dating is now common in the younger generation  but telling your family about a significant other  an engagement so in an indian context  for many people  its putting the cart before the horse to announce the relationship prior to an engagement  if your relationship is strong in every other way  a reluctance to tell the extended family does not signify a lack of belief in it on her part assuming your relationship is in good shape in every other way  she isnt hiding behind indian culture  shes doing her best to balance her familys worldview with your worldview  and this takes time and effort many people who have to inhabit multiple worlds go through this process perhaps one way to proceed is to get on her team  become her partner and ally in negotiating between cultures after all  once you marry an indian  youve joined the wild and subtle dance of inhabiting multiple cultures for life  my friend  so ask questions  something like what does your family think about x? what can we do to set them at ease about x? how can we communicate to them that xyz is important to me us? what is important to them   what are their concerns about x?get yourselves on the same team  so that youre not another node in the cultural tugofwar once more  every person and every relationship is unique  and so is every family  so take my thoughts with a pinch of salt dude im an indian girl engaged to a non indian  and half my family still doesnt know trust me  its less drama this way ask her if her mom is against the extended family knowing how does she plan to break the news of the marriage to them? how old are you both? im from coimbatore and its still a very conservative place compared to other big cities her reservations about revealing about you to her family could be because of two reasons most families here are not very encouraging of love marriages and doubly so when its interracial she may be holding off because she doesnt want the extended family making unwanted remarks about her relationship it is not unusual for the family to reveal to others in the extended family about the relationship only after the wedding dates are set in a conservative south indian set up theres only courting no dating also she may not be very sure of what the future holds especially since you guys may end up living in different cities and if it doesnt work out  if she has to get an arranged marriage then if her extended family knows about a prior relationship with an american her value in the arranged marriage market goes down you need to ask yourself this first is it really necessary for you to want her extended family to know about you?over here in some conservative communities   extended family will poke their huge noses in every matter im not exaggerating by any means it is a nuisance  imagine them calling you everyday and asking why you dont have kids and then making fun of you for not being a man and earning more than his wife they will berate you  your partner is aware of that and is trying to tread carefully here  so understand her side  know that this is a serious situation and give her time to deal with this  also take some time to brush up on her family politics lol a lot of indian families are very close knit  children  even after 18  are close with their parents and often support them financially too parents too support their children  emotionally and financiallyhere are a few things you need to consider find out how close is she to her family how orthodox is her family  immediate most importantlyif shes really close and is from an orthodox family  youre definitely in for trouble reason being its quite likely they would want an arrangement within the faith and even possibly the same language that being said  if shes not really close she may still be okay going against their wishes but if she is really close  99 chance she will not go against their wishes though youve probably been told this  marrying someone from another country  heck  even just a slightly different community then your own is a huge deal in india having a job and being independent would give her more standing and give her decisions  like deciding to marry you  more weight and respect in the community my cousin was dating his gf for about 6 years  who was also from india but from a different state  before he told his parents because he was waiting to get a good job when i told my parents about my girlfriend who was indian but was christian  there were fights and tears for several months and my own mother couldnt talk to me for an entire month this despite the fact that were comparatively a very progressive family  with several relatives including myself living abroad and all this is exponentially harder for a girl because india is still quite patriarchal and women asserting their independence can cause major freakouts so please realise that this isnt about you you dont have to convince her of anything or explain to her how important it is to you etc etc she already knows all these things and she agrees with all these things she is on your side however  the careful manoeuvres required to inform parents and extended family leave those decisions to her she has taken the first steps which is telling her sister and her mother my guess is her mother is still getting acclimatized to the idea and before she tells her father she would need her mothers support if mothers support is there  even if her father gets upset she  your gf  will have someone on the inside  her mom  to placate him otherwise things could get ugly fast again its not about you at all its unfortunate that indian families are like this but these tight family bonds lead to a much more supportive  connected and loving family structure once all this blows over and you wont regret it its just that some people are old fashioned and need some time to come to terms with big changes all their life her parents probably had ideas on what her wedding would be like or what kind of groom they will find for her and they have to suddenly make a 180 on the things theyve simply believed all their livessimilar issues will arise when her parents want to tell the rest of the family there are a lot of things they will consider things like timing and maybe first slowly introducing the idea that shes dating someone without revealing who it is they may also want to go in person to have this discussion in the case in my family each move was very carefully planned and we arent even particularly close or dependant on the extended family if you want to make things easier for her  make some efforts to understand her culture learn a bit of the language  buy some traditional indian clothes  with her help  read up on indian history so you better understand the context of some things and make sure to support her when she starts facing push back  which she 100 will  from her family and extended family people may say awful things about her to her face  stuff that makes her cry your job is not to get angry at that moment or say something like fuck those guys how dare they say that and try and break away from the family instead be patient and give it time  lots of time be like a river that carves its way through a canyon just with patience and time you can win over even the most conservative folks in her family but she has to be the one taking these decisions on how to move the needle forward just trust her and wait about the job thing  there isnt anything extra you can do she knows its important too  but far more important things are on the line  lifelong family relationships and she definitely has to prioritize that if she messes it up  both the job and the relationships get fucked she must be smart enough to know that this stuff is time sensitive  shes struggling with these decisions as well i cant imagine there is anything you can tell her she hasnt thought of already i am a guy who is born and bred in  coimbatorein  https  coimbatorein  the last 45 years i am seeing comparatively a lot more indian guys girls are getting married to non indians than ever beforechill my only advice is to let her know how much she means to you dont fret too much about being being accepted to her extended family and let herthe coming out part to herone tip is once things get settled  get a hang of things what you can say or not to say from  herin  https  herin  india typically value if your parents have had a strong and long relationship and fret if you have step moms dads taking it as a sign of you not being brought up properly or not marriage materialanother one is fold your hands and greet elders with a vanakkam for extra brownie points im dating a nonindian so maybe i can offer some perspective ive met his family several times they were very sweet people and we loved each other a lot nobody in my family is even aware of his existence i cannot even begin to imagine the drama if i tell them i am pretty serious about him  and i do plan to tell them someday once my bf gets a job and settles down but for now? i definitely dont wanna deal with that bc indian parents + relatives are the most annoying people on the planet its not a you problem its a them problem its better off that you tell them as late as possible once everything  like ur wedding date etc  is set  or better yet  not tell them at all tbqh  i dont hold my relatives in high regard and id prefer they never knew of my boyfriend even after he becomes my husband it does create some friction that hes never met anybody on my side  but i do try to emphasize that these people dont matter that much to me maybe u should consider why its so important to you that her family needs to know about you like i get it if u have a really good relationship with ur family  and maybe she doesnt get along with hers in that case she wouldnt want them to tell them at all you are asking relationship advice on a forum where 99 of the population have never had contact with the opposite sex have patience  wait a while get the job after graduation and everything will sail through smoothly they wont budge an eye when they see how wellestablished their girl is with you  emotionally and of course financially you need to ask her about why she is against the extended family knowing about both of you you need her to give you an honest answer and you need to really really understand whether the answer is honest if you think the part of her family currently in america is relatively cool with you guys being together  she could try telling them? may be living in america has eased a bit of cultural difference in them to make things easy? thats the least drama filled solution that i can think of  considering time is an issue i may not be qualified person to tell u this but as it involves the word genuine love i would love to help uall indian parents wants their kids to be merried into thier own culture   mostly with same level family  because  for most of the people here in india their cast  name and traditions play very much important role people here thinks that for foreigners marriage is like a just play because  in america people usually have relationship outside their marriage and can take divorce at any time asia has a more divorce rate compare to usa most of their concern is foreign countries culture that they are practicingand fact is that indias metropolitan cities are  also on the same track trying to copy all the things what other developed nation likes like live in relationship  intercourse before merraige and divorcestill in 21 century in india  there are so many topics that still considers taboo or not publicly open dont take it personally but at the last  i would say if u really truly love this girl and wont leave her hand till ur last breath then just go to her parents and tell them u are the only person who will love her more than her father and she would be happy and secure with u u wont let her down at any point of her life  tips start taking interest in their traditions  all the best for u  deleted  yeah all that hiding behind indian culture is all bs shes being a coward worrying about the opinion of extended family you making less money than her will definitely be the bigger issue with her family make sure that she is not using you for a green card sourceindian american i can understand why its difficult for her to her family about you  marriage with no job and that to with a foreigner but i cant understand  if you guys are in a hurry and she really wants to marry you  whats taking her so long the worst case scenario is her american relatives saying no  or they may help her but not you or they may help both of you if her parents have agreed to your marriage  its less likely that her american family will deny the stay her reasoning is simple if this relationship doesnt work and end up in marriage  she will be humiliated she might not even get good marriage proposals if she wants to go the arranged marriage route later her concerns are valid you wont lose much if this relationship doesnt work out except the heartbreak   but if she wants to maintain a dignified image before her extended family  she has to think pragmatically sounds pretty shady to me  man  the whole not telling to other than parents and stuff just shows the lack of courage i think you need to have a direct talk about how things are going to done and handled by her ask her questions and get down to playing different scenarios and stuff and dont give in to the will think about it later or i dont want to think about it now answers  its just another way of saying i dont have the courage to do it now set a deadline for her to give you answersedit and vanakkam   thats tamil  advice ille  removed ,2020-04-21 18:30:23

Politics,this government had money to splurge on statues  why are they asking for donations now?,745,fs0svb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fs0svb/this_government_had_money_to_splurge_on_statues/,111,modi government spent several thousands of crores on building statues  but they dont have money for carrying out enough testing to check the spread of coronavirus  or for providing proper protective equipments to doctors  nurses and other support staffs bjp has enough money to buy mlas in karnataka  madhya pradesh etc  but they want common people to contribute to this pm cares fund  they  modi govt   bjp  have money for running their it cell  and for supporting massive pr campaigns for modi  but they dont have money for investing in basic healthcare infrastructure in the country they want  taxpaying  people to donate to pay for the sins of the govrnment i would rather help my neighbours and my community than donate to these morons let all the bhakts contribute now,ErDrProf, for the same reason they build that statue publicity dont forget new parliament and central vista redevelopment project to build more statuesso you can die happily by seeing big statues because pm cares  s i wonder why government has no money oh waitwhat did shashikant das  the new rbi governor do  1st thing he joined the office? oh yeahempty the rbi treasury saved for national emergency the government doesnt care about serving the people  all they care about is staying in power for that they are ready to spend millions on statues also  this pmcares is a new trust setup outside the ambit of the cag right? the funds cannot be audited for how they were used i assume? they are essentially setting up a fund without parliamentary oversight if that is true  correct?arrgh  i have too many questions and i just cant seem to trust this governmentedit #1 it looks like others are asking the same question online also  it seems contributions to this fund are only 50 eligible for tax rebate whereas the pm relief fund  the older fund  is 100 tax rebate eligible this is mysterious why the fuck would you want to contribute to the fund when you dont even get 100 tax rebate for what you donated? also bhakts are going on a rampage against those asking a valid question on twittermore discussion and bhakt randi rona https  twittercom sardesairajdeep status 1244573608015429638edit #2 this is getting mukier as of now  i hear public sector bank employees are being asked to give up two days of salary mandatorily voluntarily for this fund someone needs to dig into this to understand how this can be imposed on people mandatorily and that too for a shady trust fund that probably has no oversight we must not forget that everything and everyone is used only for pr by this regimeonce one understands that  other pieces automatically fall into place bro you dont understand its another masterstroke you know how nehru is the source of all things evil? well guess who introduced the pms relief fund??how the hell do you expect nehru money to be good?? so our great great prime minister started the pmcares because he cares about us our great great modiji has been planning all along not just to help covid19 patients but to flush out blek monnow watch helplessly in the next campaign when pmcares fund is shoved down everyones throat as being the savior of the pandemic crisis and you know what the bhakts are gonna fap to it trust me they already are probably thinking dusre leaders ne aisa kyu nai kiya ab tak people are emotional and govt milking itbtw he promised 15 lakhs in every account loland we giving more to him better give money to some ngo or to some poor personally  deleted  thats why i never donated to them i will help whoever i can directly or through reputed ngos pmcares oh the irony we should also ask that where is the massive amounts of money collected from demo  gst etc? meanwhile akshay kumar donating the same money donated to him by mudi buying mlas  thats what i have been rooting for ever since this whole fund was announced   bhakts trending hashtags like  virat kholi donate   akshay kumar donate etc    i mean these people already pay 100s of crores in taxes   where the hell is that money going ? why the taxpayers need to pay for their own well being ? that account isnt gov account they arent obligated to show where money is spent it will be used to buy mla in rajasthan i get this is an anti bjp post  but id be happy if it were a post criticising the incumbents we live in a country whose very constitution has a directive principle relating to the development of scientific temper among people and the policymakers but it is sad to see that as time passed  governments gave into divisive politics using the right wing ideology extensively along with hate sentiments the educated cut themselves off from the democratic exercise and the uneducated started to elect policymakers hence  all we get is freebies and people pleasing stunts and nothing else no structural reforms and  to our dismay  people who really wished to work for the greater good  were never allowed to do so by their very own people i have no problem with people hating a political party but  it wouldve been pleasurable to see educated  technologically forward people critiquing the incumbents and not letting their hate for a said group get the better of themi say this holding in regard the very principle of a democratic set up which dictates that there are only legislators in the parliament  and no political parties sadly  our very own modern and contemprary leaders have lost sight of this axiomand let us not forget the times of the great statesman mr atal bihari vajpayee ji and mr nehru  who truly displayed what a democratic country looks like  by their joint discussions about law and policy and  not dragging their differences into the public domain and ripping each other to shreds  which is very  very common in this 21st century india to buy mlas or to make more statutes ?

keep it as short yet detailed as possiblethe jallianwala bagh massacre  also known as the amritsar massacre  took place on 13 april 1919  when acting brigadiergeneral reginald dyer ordered troops of the british indian army to fire their rifles into a crowd of unarmed indian civilians in jallianwala bagh  amritsar  punjab  killing at least 400 people including men and women over 1 000 people were injuredsome facts about the jallianwala bagh massacre1 the precursor to the massacre was the rowlatt act this act was passed in february 19192 the rowlatt act gave the british government the authority to arrest anyone on grounds of mere suspicion3 the rowlatt act was basically designed for controlling activities of indian revolutionaries4 protesting against the act  the indians observed a hartal on march 30th and april 6th of 19195 on april 10  1919  two famous leaders  dr kitchlew and dr satyapal were arrested on the basis of the rowlatt act6 two days later on the 12th of april  1919  general dyer took command of troops he issued a proclamation banning all public gatherings7 though the proclamation was issued  no efforts were made to ensure that the general public came to know about it8 the gathering had no political intent at all it was meant for celebrating baisakhi  the sikh festival9 anywhere between 6 000 and 10 000 people gathered at jallianwala bagh on the evening of that day10 the gathering included even children and women since it was all about celebrating baisakhi11 though the festival was a sikh festival  many hindus and muslims also came to celebrate the same all of them were there for commemorating the day when khalsa panth was founded by guru gobind singh12 apart from the main entrance  there was no way for the crowd to escape the garden as the area was surrounded by buildings this is a major reason for the high number of casualties13 apart from gurkha and  baluchi soldiers using scinde rifles  there were also two armored cars with machine guns that were used in the shooting14 according to records  the people gathered were not warned or asked to disperse before colonel dyer ordered the firing15 the firings stopped only when the soldiers ran out of ammunition16 the shooting was followed by the proclamation of  martial law  https  wwwbritannicacom topic martiallaw  in the punjab that included public floggings and other humiliations17 indian outrage grew as news of the shooting and subsequent british actions spread throughout the subcontinent the bengali poet and nobel laureate rabindranath tagore renounced the knighthood that he had received in 191518 gandhi was initially hesitant to act  but he soon began organizing his first largescale and sustained nonviolent protest   satyagraha  https  wwwbritannicacom topic satyagrahaphilosophy   campaign  the  noncooperation movement  https  wwwbritannicacom event noncooperationmovement   192022   which thrust him to prominence in the indian nationalist struggle19 dyer was initially lauded for his actions in britain and became a hero among many who were directly benefiting from the  british raj  https  enwikipediaorg wiki british_raj  such as members of the  house of lords  https  enwikipediaorg wiki house_of_lords  he was  however  widely criticised in the  house of commons  https  enwikipediaorg wiki house_of_commons   whose july 1920 committee of

for his actions and ordered him to resign from the military21 the last known survivor of the jallianwala bagh massacre  shingara singh  died in amritsar on june 29  2009  at the age of 11322 the british government tried to suppress information of the massacre  but news spread in india and widespread outrage ensued  details of the massacre did not become known in britain until december 191923 this event caused many moderate indians to abandon their loyalty to the  british and become nationalists distrustful of the british24 colonel dyer reported to his superiors that he had been confronted by a  revolutionary army  to which major general william beynon replied  your action correct and lieutenant governor approves25 both  secretary of state for war  https  enwikipediaorg wiki secretary_of_state_for_war   winston churchill  https  enwikipediaorg wiki winston_churchill  and former prime minister  h h asquith  https  enwikipediaorg wiki h_h_asquith    however  openly condemned the attack  churchill referring to it as  unutterably monstrous  while asquith called it one of the worst  most dreadful  outrages in the whole of our history26 winston churchill  in the house of commons debate of 8 july 1920  said   the crowd was unarmed  except with bludgeons it was not attacking anybody or anything when the fire had been opened upon it to disperse it   it tried to run away pinned up in a narrow place considerably smaller than trafalgar square  with hardly any exits  and packed together so that one bullet would drive through three or four bodies  the people ran madly this way and the other when the fire was directed upon the centre  they ran to the sides the fire was then directed to the sides  many threw themselves down on the ground  the fire was then directed down on the ground this was continued to 8 to 10 minutes  and it  stopped only when the ammunition had reached the point of exhaustion27 after churchills speech in the house of commons debate

explainedi did it because i had a grudge against him he deserved  it he was the real culprit he wanted to crush the spirit of my  people  so i have crushed him for full 21 years  i have been trying to  seek vengeance i am happy that i have done the job i am not scared of  death i am dying for my country  i have seen my people starving in  india under the british rule i have protested against this

discussion  he continued    i do not care about the sentence of death it means nothing at all  i do not care about dying or anything i do not worry about it at all i  am dying for a purpose thumping the rail of the dock  he exclaimed   we are suffering from the british empire udham singh continued more quietly i am not afraid to die i am proud to die  to have to free my native land and i hope that when i am gone  i hope that in my place will come thousands of my countrymen to drive you dirty dogs out  to free my country    i am standing before an english jury i am in an english court  you

was witnessed by a young bhagat singh which eventually lead him to become disillusioned with gandhis ideals of nonviolence given the quality and frequency of your posts  i presumed you were one of the mods random fact general reginal dyers father edward abraham dyer set up a brewery inkasauli himachal pradeshto cater to the british requirement for cheap beer this brewery changed hands and became a distillery by the name of mohan meakin pvt ltd which is popularly known as old monk til the gathering had no political intent i always thought there was an element of protest too  against the detention of saifuddin kitchlew and lala lajpat rai  i think  thanks for the info lovely please make a compilation of the anti sikh riots of 1984 as well if possible     29 colonel reginald dyer was shot dead on 13 march  1940  by a man named udham singhi believe youve mistakenly mixed michael odwyer name with colonel reginald dyer wow the movies only say about the dyer running back to uk and never returning back to india  i did not know that he was assassinated until i read your post thanks for telling me something new have an upvote op   almost 80 years after shaheed udham singh was executed  we still swim nose deep in imperialism and millions of children die every year because of imperialist exploitationthey say  there are no guns anymore  but that only means death is slower and more painful  nice read more about it and the general surrounding conditions and the apparent british thinking behind it read jallianwala bagh an empire of fear and the making of the amritsar massacre though the festival was a sikh festival  many hindus and muslims also came to celebrate the same all of them were there for commemorating the day when khalsa panth was founded by guru gobind singh this that hindumuslimsikhisae bhai bhai feeling  mera aaj ka til hogaya re dhanyawaad prabhu bhai only 4 points are required karke teacher ne bola tha itna kyun likha ysk general dyer  the main guy responsible for the massacre returned to england and died of old age the dyer that udham singh assassinated was also involved but was a totally different person i mean the point about gandhi isnt really a surprise he was  hesitant to do anything against the british a man whos entire lifes work is based on the concept of non violence  recruiting 2 million indians to fight for the allies to show the british government indians dont mean any  animosity towards them either you lot are crazy for thinking hes the father of the nation or im crazy for thinking that if anything  that guy just slowed down the independence process he used to call himself ram mohammad singh azad off topic i visited the jallianwala bagh in november last year but sadly it was under renovation and very poorly maintained i hope it is in a much better now i was surprised to see how close it is to the golden temple  https  wwwyoutubecom watch?vvuygicomer8  https  wwwyoutubecom watch?vvuygicomer8   deleted

Politics,did sharad pawar  ncp  congress and shiv sena just defeat bjp in the greatest game of political chess to have been played in india?,830,e1yy9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e1yy9u/did_sharad_pawar_ncp_congress_and_shiv_sena_just/,125,after weeks of political maneuvering  backstabbing and drama that if it were made into a television series would rival game of thrones and house of cards  and were not talking about s8 got and s6 hoc   it looks like were finally getting some clarity about what is happening  what has happened and what will happen in maharashtraif you havent been following  here is what happened the people of maharashtra voted in the state elections on 21 10 2019 the primary alliances competing in the elections were the nda  made up of bjp and shiv sena  and the upa  made up of ncp and congress  bjp lost 17 seats and shiv sena lost 7 while congress gained 2 seats and the ncp gained 13 bjp got the largest share of votes but no individual party got enough seats to form a majority government  required number of seats to form a government in the maharashtra vidhan sabha is 145  after the results were declared  the shiv sena refused to form a government with the bjp because their demands for equal share in power and the post of cm for 25 years was not met the governor  a member of the bjp and rss btw   from the 8th to the 11th of november  invited the bjp  then the shiv sena and then the ncp to form the government and prove majority after all parties either refused to or failed to prove majority  presidents rule was imposed on 12th november meanwhile  the congress  ncp and the shiv sena  which has historically opposed and has been opposed by the congress and ncp and has a vastly different ideology compared to the ncp and the congress   entered into an alliance together to form the government before they could form the government though  ajit pawar  nephew of sharad pawar and his chosen representative  broke away from the ncp along with a few rebel mlas and joined hands with the bjp to form the government on 23 november  at 536 am  the governor revoked presidents rule and accepted the formation of the bjpajit pawar government  administering the oath of office to devendra fadnavis  who became the cm and entered his second term   and ajit pawar  who became deputy cm suspiciously  around this same time  all corruption charges and investigations against ajit pawar were dropped the congress  ncp and shiv sena challenged the formation of this government in the supreme court and demanded a floor test sharad pawar publicly disavowed ajit pawar and his actions the supreme court directed the new government to prove its majority by evening today today  unable to prove majority  devendra fadnavis and ajit pawar resigned and the new government was dissolvedwhat is happening  as of 1942 ist  and will happen the congress  ncp and shiv sena will form government with uddhav thackeray as the cm mlas from all three parties are in the trident hotel rn to elect uddhav as their cm ajit pawar and the rebel mlas from the ncp are back in the ncp ajit pawar will be deputy cm  edit its still left to be seen what ajit pawars fate is but the process of reconciliation seems to have already started  the terms of the power sharing  afaik  are still unknown but will most probably be that shiv sena and ncp will hold the cm post for 25 years each with the congress will play a supporting role  with all three parties sharing equal power edit what follows is speculation from my side but imo it is very probable that this might have happened  now all this might seem like a crazy series of events  but i cant help but feel that all events  after the shiv sena entered into an alliance with the ncp and congress  have been carefully orchestrated by all three parties and especially sharad pawar  who i believe has shown amit shah that shah is still a diaperwearing amateur at a game that pawar is a veteran of sharad pawar and co have managed to split the senabjp alliance although the alliance was always rocky  pawar and co have managed to split a natural alliance of the bjp and shiv sena that was borne out of a shared hindutva idealogy  while simultaneously managing to form an alliance with their bitter rivals prevent bjp from forming the government now this seems super obvious  but its very impressive considering the fact that bjp netted the most amount of votes in the election exposed the hypocrisy of the bjp bjp has always run on a platform that stated that their party and government were not corrupt  unlike the opposition who has had multiple huge corruption scandals it was one of the major reasons why they won in 2014 now  after the saga with ajit pawar  who  lets face it  was never seriously splitting with the ncp  and all this was just a ploy   sharad pawar has managed to expose the corrupt nature of the bjp in a very public manner saved ajit pawar from jail this is the cherry on top for pawar and co and possibly the most stinging thing to happen to the bjp during this whole saga pawar has not just managed to expose the corruption of the bjp but also managed to save his nephew from the consequences of corruption using his enemy as the deliverer tool of salvationnow all this is great and dandy for pawar  ncp  shiv sena and the congress but what does it mean for us observers and the voters of maharashtra? well these are the conclusions i ended up on after this whole saga democracy is dead im sure all the voters who voted for shiv sena because they wanted the bjp in power and all the voters who voted for ncp and congress because they did not want the shiv sena in power are feeling duped  betrayed and angry rn  and they have a very good reason to be if  ultimately  the choice of a population does not even matter  what point is there to democracy? what point is there to voting? might as well choose the next government based on who is better at jenga or monopoly  sharad pawar  uddhav thackeray  devendra fadnavis or balasaheb thorat integrity  ideology and principles dont matter all that matters now is power yeah the congress  ncp and shiv sena have managed to defeat the bjp but at what cost? all parties involved have betrayed the core principles and ideas upon which their parties were found by entering into this alliance why even have separate parties then?  voters dont matter all 3 parties have betrayed the trust that their voters and supporters placed in them meanwhile the bjp has betrayed the trust that the general public lays on institutions and figures like the governor who are supposed to be neutralsharad pawar and co might have just managed to win the greatest game of political chess to have been played in india but it is the rest of us common folk who have lost regardless of which political ideology you believe in or which party you support  i hope you can agree when i say that this entire saga was a dark period for democracy in indiaedit we still cant say for sure if this whole ajit pawar saga was a carefully constructed ploy or if he actually betrayed  he is know to make rash decisions  sharad pawar he wasnt present at the joint press conference of the parties where uddhav thackeray was announced as the cm and some ncp members asked sharad pawar to ensure that ajit pawar is back in the fold asap so its still unclear but i can definitely say for sure that whether this was by intention or not  it has only helped the ncpshiv senacongress alliance,jasonj2232, as someone who doesnt follow politics thank you for summarising everything that has happened i was so confused wtf was going on all this time appreciate the effort in this post hardly the greatest  but yesfor once  shah was defeated at his own game no less whatever has happened has for the good1 shivsena is no longer hindutva party  it has entered into its third phase  1st  may marathi bhoomiputra  2nd  hindutva  3rd  cosmopolitan mumbaiyya with shades of sons of soil politics gives it a lot of space to maneuver2 ncp + shivsena + congress is going to be a formidable coalition however  there might be issues when they fight the next election  but that is something way in the future 3 bjp is on backfoot  but it has room to grow it is no longer restricted by shivsena in terms of seat sharing but it will never get a majority of its own tough task ahead especially after string of losses in various states it can think of venturing into new territories like odisha bengal but those arent a sure shot it might even lose jharkhand4 this also brings an end  somewhat  to ideological fights there are only 2 left  bjp and antibjp5 ideology ka dhong band karna chahiye every party craves power that is their only ideology thanks for this detailed breakdown as an nri i cant really seem to trust mainstream news completely because almost every one of them has an agenda or are paid by politicians  i would give you silver if i had the coins here is some fake silver  people like pawar  devegowda  lallu n the next level like bsy  siddu  dkshi etc  sorry for quoting on ka names  but i am sure there are others too  are very well versed with how to play the game unlike the pseudo chanakyas who only know the language of threat  temptation of money not always can one win by misusing power is what is being proven yet again here  democracy is dead #x200b people do not vote for parties though  ideally by design  they vote for individual representatives thats why i am against the party system  after the results were declared  the shiv sena refused to form a government with the bjp because their demands for equal share in power and the post of cm for 25 years was not meti disagree with this we do not know if bjp promised the cm post or no hence cant just decide ss is the one to blame for their alliance falling apart though of course that has become or been made the popular narrativeand this doesnt seem like sp pulling a fast one on the bjp but the bjp committing suicide they won the electionwhen ss refused to play second fiddle all they had to do was play the victim card and claim the moral high ground when the state went to reelection they would have the narrative in their favourwhat i think has happened is that fadnavis tried to assert himself and bit off more than he could chew he assured delhi he would get the bjp a majority on its own which is why i think they probably did promise ss the cm seat on rotation basis so there would be no splitting of votes  intending to backstab them when they had won a simple majority on their own they didnt and that made his position vulnerable he has enemies within the state bjp  and doesnt get along with nitin gadkari he had to do something then this drama played out whether he tried to poach ncp mlas or pawar played him  this whole thing happened because of bjps and fadnavis arrogance fadnavis owes his position to shahmodi the duo needed him to stay in power so they could influence the state which has traditionally not had good relations with outsiders and gujaratis in particular due to the splitting of bombay state and he needed them to remain in power against gadkaris faction   how a tug of war between fadnavis and gadkari results in maharashtra stalemate   https  wwwcnbctv18com politics howatugofwarbetweenfadnavisandgadkariresultsinmaharashtrastalemate4663851htm  maharashtra politics are efforts on to edge out devendra fadnavis?  https  wwwthehindubusinesslinecom news national maharashtrapoliticsareeffortsontoedgeoutdevendrafadnavis article29896758ece   ajit pawar and the rebel mlas from the ncp are back in the ncp ajit pawar will be deputy cmlmao #whaat the game has just begun the same happened in karnataka  but look who is in power now its a battle for survival for shiv sena  and pawar helped it isnt going to mean anything more to ncp than having a share in the power of this government but for shiv sena  this means everything balasaheb was the man hypothetically  if he comes back  demands that sena workers bring him the heads of every sena mla right now  their party cadres would do this in 20 minutes not going into the character  ideology of balasaheb   good  bad  ugly  but this was his pull even bjp knew they cant mess with him they accepted being the lesser power out of two after balasaheb  bjp realized they could be bigger partner and  sena saw the ground slipping they only have maharashtra  bjp has the whole country if they let them become the senior partner  why would sena survive 10 years from now in battle of survival  you befriend the devils you hate a bhakt told me that fadnavis got into cm chair and the first thing he did was to clear some farmer relief fund turned out to be truebut yeah  i still think that was a shit display by all parties more entertaining than any hbo or netflix series  democracy is deadim pretty sure indian democracy exceeds the lives allotted to a cat every week  given the number of times its been pronounced dead its fun to make strong  hyperbolic statements innitthe mandate was for bjp + ss the _+_ there didnt work out  so the govt will now by lead by 3 parties with a combined 48 of the vote sharewas that really the mandate? sure  nohave all of them proven to be greedy pigs? sure  yesis it bad for mh? will we see return of blatant lowlevel corruption  and kneejerk cancellation of bjps pet infra projects? probablywill the effects of this political game play out in the next election? itd be stupid to expect bjp to not revise their alliance arrangements wrt shiv senaultimately  do the coalition parties represent the largest share of the coalition mandate at 48 of the total votes? if im adding 16  16  and 16 correctly  im gonna hazard a guess and say yes? these games dont matter what matters is keeping the alliance together this is the closest we have seen to a successful implementation of the fabled mahagathbandan making the ghatbandan work in maharashtra will go a long way to proving its feasibility for the voters these three parties need to keep that in mind  play the long game  and focus on delivering results for the people will solve a lot of their problems  all at once well written postthis is no victory  but a remarkable resistance of ruthless poweri think that this scenario is similar to what we saw in karnataka fractured mandate  bjp biased governor hurriedly installs a bjp cm opponents unite  run the government for few years  bjp uses central investigation agencies to go after corrupt opponents  government falls  mlas migrate to bjp out of fear or opportunity  bjp comes back to powerunless aap becomes strong  there is no stopping bjp in the long run this is truly scary  worse scenario pawar has dealt the death blow to modishah combine their air of invincibility has been broken modi is not gonna take this loss kindly the antishah voices in bjp and rss are gonna be fanned shah is vulnerable and the vultures are circling overhead all corruption charges and investigations against ajit pawar were droppedthis one is not correct though acb has released a statement saying that some open enquiries have been closed against ajit pawar  and none of them have anything to do with the irrigation scam he has around 40 cases against him apparently appreciate the effort to articulate the saga entirely  though great job excellent summary thank you  democracy is deadhold on to these grandiloquent pronouncements  shiv sena and bjp are living off the hindutva votebank and they appeal to the same class of voters if both of them were to contest elections separately  the hindutva votebank will split and none of them will win so  their alliance was a convenience to let both parties remain relevant dishonouring prepoll alliance is not against the constitution  so  technically democracy is not dead  yet what pawar did1 first gets shiv sena to stick to 5050 formula until alliance collapses2  then he gets shiv sena to quit nda3  then he gets bjp to drop cases against ajit pawar4  then he forces ajit to quit  fadnavis to quit twice within 2 weekspawar ensured thata   bjp have egg on their faceb   get accused of subverting democratic normsc   besmirched reputations of the highest constitutional offices it is indeed greatest game ever played pawar should open a school where politics chanakya niti is taught,2019-11-27 04:21:44
Politics, politics  how would india have looked like if it was subash chandra bose who took over as first prime minister?,3,ewi9qq,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ewi9qq/politics_how_would_india_have_looked_like_if_it/,42,https  shodhgangainflibnetacin bitstream 10603 155944 7 07_chapter204pdfit was well known he was a hard left individual  with interests in the russian revolutions marxist and socialist policies he was a patriot and nationalist but never thrived off of it in my view  it was the best kind of positive nationalism wherein you respected and fought for your nations freedom and dignity but also participated in the active growth of its people from a moral and economical standpoint and did not rely on relentless fanning of the flames to attain unityimagine an india which was built on strong but fair leftist grounds which stressed on equality of sexes  equality of opportunity  mandatory education  economic liberation  powerful military and more with equal stress on india being democratic republic  subhash chandra bose never interpreted nationalism in its narrow  perverted and aggressive form he viewed indian nationalism from the stand point of  a humanist to3 bose  indian nationalism is neither narrow  nor selfish  nor aggressiveit is inspired by the highest ideals of the human racethere is unequivocally nothing that can really beat this combination of nonexploitative  nonauthoritarian socialist country i know some thinktanks have flirted with the idea of bose being a hitler but one  he was prodemocracy and two when i first visited germany in 1933  i had hopes that the new german nation  which has risen to a new consciousness of its national strength and selfrespect  would instinctively feel a deep sympathy for other nations struggling in the same directiontoday i regret that i have to return to india with the conviction that the new nationalism of germany is not only narrow and selfish  but also arrogantin my opinion  india should have been under a rigorous leadership for a decade or so to set the grounds for mass education  equal opportunities  equality of sexes  liberal economic principles and abolition of poverty and then gone on to open up the market internationally and engage in  controlled  capitalistic ventures where you invest in foreign countries and foreign countries can invest in yours  independent businesses can thrive and so on and which will see a surge in not only economic status but exchange of culture with the people of india ready for such a venture as opposed to now where most indians barely know who they are  what their history is and what their culture is about,Budget-Independent, something like cuba and pretty much under a left dictatorship and would have moved in the same direction as pakistan its a counter factual  ie  a logical fallacyyou have no way of knowing what would have happened maybe he would have gone the way of stalin and become an authoritarian dictator maybe his alliance with the axis powers would have meant the allies bombing indiaat the end of the day  these what if scenarios are academically interesting but dont mean anything might as well read gandhi the zombie hunter not this wishful imaginary crap againscb was known a megalomaniac by his political peers a more realistic outcome under him would be india  somewhat like cuba  crumbling  failing stateedit some context  here  https  mtimesofindiacom india netajisubhaschandrabosewantedruthlessdictatorshipinindiafor20years articleshow 46980513cms  i feel like taiwan or some african dictatorship best case scenario people become disciplined but overthrow dictatorship to form a strong economy worse case scenario people are suppressed into obedience and have to tolerate all sorts of corruption and bullshit current india is heading towards the second scenario btw  deleted  this is a fun exercisei think if bose had made it back and not executed by the british he wouldve had a grip on bengal which was were a lot of rioting was going on his charisma wouldve trounced jinnah and the muslim league in bengal without bengali muslims on your side  two nation theory was a much harder sell abdul ghaffar khan was with gandhi so pushtans werent going to join the call you would basically have east punjab and sindh who would not have the votes to partitionhe probably wouldve sent any right wingers  both hindu and muslim  to the gulagshe wouldve done land reforms in that period which wouldve altered the societal power dynamics perhaps what we see in cities today wouldve be how it is in villages?i think all the same nation building exercises wouldve been done the first decade like nehru didby end of 10 years it would be a toss up if democracy would even come back you would see massive caste violence all across hindu majority areas of india to take back power by upper castes a lot of communal poison would be spread by muslim elites in punjab and sindh to usurp powerwomen of india wouldve been better off once you put girls in school theres no going backnehru and patel would be under house arrest ambedkar would be the upper caste childrens boogie manthe military wouldve been a lot stronger so there would be high chance for coups like in pakistanoh the north east rebellions wouldve been put down brutallyif democracy is your number one goal  this would be a nightmare if social justice was your number one goal  this honestly doesnt sound half bad  india should have been under a rigorous leadership for a decade or so to set the grounds for mass education  equal opportunities  equality of sexes  liberal economic principles and abolition of poverty and then gone on to open up the market internationallythis is exactly happened in india more or less atleast in principle our constitution as envisioned by our forefathers wanted this now practically could it have been done better  sure would bose have been able to have done it better? may be  may be not what if his successors were not that good? i dont see much difference to what could have turned out  honestly now would he have been more aggressive in curbing the sangh and banning the rss?  if he had  then it could have been a lot better for india but again i am not too sure since he had allied with axis powers  he would have been tried for his allegiance india would have been very different from the present day given that indian constitution is supreme  he would have implemented dpsps in his own way  deleted ,2020-01-31 17:15:31

Business/Finance,i cant get over shaktikanta das being appointed as rbi governor,344,a5ewag,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a5ewag/i_cant_get_over_shaktikanta_das_being_appointed/,114,i flaired this as business finance i guess it should be politics and non politics as wellias officers generally have no technical knowledge of the area they lead now from rr  we have gone down to the level of this guy who raped us with his demo executionnow  does this guy have any formal education in finance and economics? i couldnt find out or are we just following hard work  harvard bull shitwhat really worries me is that common people  or even educated people  or even the randia crowd dont seem to realize how serious and fucked up this could be we just dont have daily interaction with the rbi  so most dont know or care rbi policies and actions affect everything and i mean everything as if demo isnt a good example of that,badger991, its very simplethe only reason urjit patel  who offered no resistance to the governments draconian demonetisation move  flipped out when the government asked the rbi to loosen its reserves is even he realises how dangerous a move this isjaitley is out there behaving like an ignorant child saying the rbi has 3 lakh crores of surplus when in actuality  its reserves no one knows when the economy will go haywirethe worlds best economists didnt see the 2008 disaster coming so these reserves are just that reservesand since urjit didnt bend  the government kicked him out you think this was a resignation? no  it was a firing that was timed to perfectionthe replacement was announced on election result day so it gets burried in the election newsmr das with his masters in history will offer nothing but support to the governments ideasmodi wants the reserves to come out  creating a temporary surge in growth he will also announce a lot of people friendly schemes in run up the the 2019 electionsif these things happen  he truly will have fucked up the economy im buying lube and preparing my anus demo 20 is right around the corner they got das for one simple reason for the 1 lakh 3 lakh crore that jaitley and gang are eyeing the request for that money to be given from rbi reserve  will come in a week or two in a month  therell be more loans being dolled out by banks  more mudi kaka posters  more photo ops  more statues of mudi kaka himself if possible and ofcourse  for ram mandir these people will leave the country in ashes  i have one request from all of you people who understand beyond mandirmasjid  bjpcong  start educating people on our parliamentary system about mlas mps start with your friends  your domestic help tell them how it is done  counsel them not on which party to vote for but how it affects them  lets start something from our side to save whatever we have left  deleted  what really worries me is that common people  or even educated people  or even the randia crowd dont seem to realize how serious and fucked up this could be i hope the opposition takes to the social media and tells us what these people are up to most of us have a bare minimum education in matters of economics   removed  hes got a history degree and has no idea about the economics hes a government yes man a puppetthe government wants to take a huge risk and damage the countries financial stability in return for short term gainsthe movement of wealth from cash to bonds shows that this is just too risky dude is ma history  all his predecessors have been phd in economics and banking  he is just a jately lapdog    deleted  a reminder to everyone  rbi asked paytm to remove the ceo of paytm payment bank because she did not have any banking experience and now jately ji has brought in a no banking experience no economist ma history  to head rbi they think we are retarded and to reply to another comment  these sarkari training certificates have no weight what so ever i did an mba from one of these indian institute tags and we train many a sarkari afsars usually ias irs and ifs they just have to attend a few sessions and they get the certificate getting a phd from yale or harvard or mit involves original research work and on top of everything this dude implemented demonetisation  no economist worth their salt would have let this happen  im not worried if some person without some academic background gets appointed as the governor of rbi as long as his actions are carefully considered and sane also  as other commenter pointed out  its the board members who make the decisions collectively and we have experts from different fields of study in the boardwith all that said  its still a very bad decision made by the government i mean  its not unexpected that they chose someone who supported the demon to the core despite its serious flaws also  his politically conservative attitude which he fearlessly displayed in the past is something thats troubling regarding his appointment im supportive of people with very little or no academic background but with sufficient experience working in different related fields of relevance making it into key positions in apex level organizations but this man is clearly chosen with a different motive in mindas for the boards and its members being key decisions makers in the organization  i wont be surprised if theyre to replaced with other like minded experts as our newly appointed governor if the present members show any kind of disappointment in the decision taking no organization is devoid of factions but what weve seen till now is that these apex organizations were given a significant freedom to operate on those level of factions that were divided on academic grounds which is undeniably a healthy division but the recent divisions that developed within the organization are toxic to this organization and thereby to the country as a whole because the core ideology is that of political  rather than being an economic or social onethis appointment is very much like the appointment of betsy devos as us secretary of education or kavanaughs appointment to the us supreme court abuse of power and unhealthy political involvement in matters that are unrelated lets see how this will unfold in times to come  to me  it matters less what his academic or research credentials are a lot of people with less formal credentials can do good jobs what matters more is that he is a government stooge totally agree with you mr das has corruption allegations against him as well  pre 2014 rbi was eyeing implementation of basel norms  and now rbi itself is getting its pillars stripped  he was mouthpiece of government during demo its election time and government will try everything possible to remain

Business/Finance,india is not  as people keep calling it  an underdeveloped country  but rather  in the context of its history and cultural heritage  a highly developed one in an advanced state of decay,0,d931fb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d931fb/india_is_not_as_people_keep_calling_it_an/,0,at the outset  i would like to state that this is not an essay that is critical of india or its people in any way i am merely stating what i have observed and what i have concluded based on these observations for this is the unvarnished truth and india cannot palate the truthmy personal example on the reluctance to work hard it is not just that  we lack ethics and morals tooi know i am going to ruffle a few feathers as there are a lot of people from the us here i am a grad student in the us working towards my phd   and most of friends here in the us are working in it related jobs what is worrying is that most of he these people got the jobs through consultants  who fake everything thing  from fake resumes to even fake phone interviews i mean these are 2223 yo with an experience of 8 years i agree that the companies dont care much about contracts jobs  but the people who work should have a sense of responsibility 80 of my undergrad friends are working in this manner their defence is that we spend so much money on education  it is only fair to earn and this is the easiest way we can earn good moneyi never intrude into others personal decisions  but this is really bothering me we buy the newest japanese and germany cars in a flash  yet pirate songs and movies we bitch about the state of politics  yet we behave the same way even worse in some cases that public servantswe lack even the basic of ethics  we litter everywhere  drive like lunatics we cant even give way to ambulances  and are pretty inconsiderate of others overall more than my disdain for politics  i am pretty annoyed by the behavior normal peoplei am not saying that i am a perfect person  at least i am being honest to myself and even though i am being paid peanuts and under a lot of pressure from my parents  i am enjoying my student life i am just sad that many people dont have and share good values the indian brain  is a phrase i have been hearing since i was a kid having been a phd candidate  and seeing how indias best and brightest compared to the worlds was an eyeopener for me sure my fellow indians too won best paper awards and fellowships  but the average of originality  creativity was far higher in some of our western counterpartsthe difference becomes even more stark  when one compares the contributions and achievements of ashkenazi jews  american or israeli  to those of indians a persecuted minority of a few millions have contributed many orders more when compared to indias privileged academic contributors say tamil brahmins of course it is worse when compared to indians as a whole what is striking is that the difference holds true even when comparing in a different field like business  finance and contrasting with gujrati  marwarisi am not exactly a selfhating indian  and am moderately proud of indian achievement when compared to some of our neighbors but that is where it unfortunately endsi recently moved southwards in the bay area from palo alto  mountain view to santa clara  san jose i dropped out of my phd and now run a moderately successful startup with some burn rate  and wanted to save some dough as we are in the process of raising money and my new residence 1  almost wants me to start hating indians the indian food is far better here  but most indians seem to be of the variety you describe consultancy or menial tech jobs they are clannish  semidumb and almost seem to be proud of their mediocrity fml  i cant wait to move to sf 1  for those who are not aware  these areas are far more indian populated though i have seen seen something similar when i visited a friend in new jerseysocrates  the father of western thought  often spoke of a concept called thumos thumos was very much a greek concept an abstract concept that held many meanings and translations however  this concept has been lost to humanity and no literal translation exists in english the essence of thumos can probably be summed up by the saying  when making a decision  a man is faced with two choices an easy path and a tough path the easy path leads to barbarism the tough to civilization and it is this tough road that every society must traverse to reach a peak taking the tougher road is an informed decision  for the natural impulse of every man is to take the easy path he has to consciously take the tougher path  and avoid the easy however  a man might unknowingly go down the easy path and end up where he did not want to be retracing your steps back to the tougher path is often a thankless and sometimes nigh on impossible task most men do not make it india too  is at this cross roads today and we might not make itit is indeed  ironic then  that i started this essay about the decline of indian civilization with a concept borrowed from the west this is not to show that indian philosophy has not reached the high levels of thought to have such a concept  but to merely show how far we have strayed from it make no such mistake for the vedas  the ultimate repository of indian philosophy  were written long  long before socrates ancestors even took up the plough and decided to grow the weeds they had observed in the wild and gave them nourishment we had reached unimaginable highs and fallen from those highs  long before socrates even had his first coherent thought all socrates did then  was rediscover what we had already known we were superior in all respects and it is in this very attitude  that lies the seed of our destruction how many times have you heard your elders say  indian culture is the best anything associated with the west is bad i hear it all the time it is a constant din in our ears anything associated with the west is decadent and immoral and inferior and indian culture is superior to every other culture  past  present and future well then  superior in exactly what manner?? few  if any  gave a concrete answer to this question if they gave an answer at allthe most common response to my question was anger and a rebuke for asking too many questions how then are we superior? if we are superior at all? let us look around the world today and ask ourselves  how many of the concepts  ideas  and objects that i use in my daily life on a daytoday basis emerged from purely indigenous sources? i asked myself this question many times  over and over again the conclusion was the same everytime none to further clarify this point  let us look at the last invention of consequence which had a purely oriental origin gunpowder and this too was taken up and advanced by the west if the chinese invented gunpowder  it was the west that developed the cannons that used them indeed  there is nothing that we can call truly our own except the past and as all of us have seen  we revere the past it is drummed into us in our schools  in our universities  in our families and at the dinner table indian culture always was and is  miles ahead of the decadent and corrupt influences of the west it is not this assertion is nothing but an inferiority complex and an aversion to the truthit is important to realize that i am not saying that india or indian culture is inferior or all that we developed as a civilization is a fabrication it is not a fabrication we were indeed a highly advanced civilization  and a highly cultured one at that but we were  and not are what we are now is a mish mash of cultures that does not know where it is headedhow did we then fall so low? how did we  we who had reached highs that even now are only dreamt of  fall to the very depths from where these highs are unimaginable? it is tempting to blame the west  colonialism  british rule and all that but the problem lies much deeper than thatevery empire is built on one strength one strength that sets it apart from the neighbours and allows it to grow while others around it stagnate the roman empire was built on the discipline of its legions most armies of that time were little more than unruly mobs and this proverbial discipline of the roman legion made it a formidable attacking force the british empire was built on the strength of the trade links between britain  a small insignificant island  and its vast territorial holdings in every corner of this planet the dominant empire today is the usa this empire is a little different for its strength stems from its culture right from hollywood  to sitcoms  our thought processes and ideas  to even what we eat and wear  it is the cultural power of the usa in full show every empire in history has had its one strength and india too had a cultural empire similar to what the usa has today a thousand years ago  students flocked from all over the world to study at nalanda and taxila just as they flock to the usa today great ideas were born in this crucible of free thought religions  philosophies and sciences were established by enlightened souls just as they are being established in the usa today however  all empires must fall the roman empire fell when the discipline of its legions eroded the british empire fell when its trade links could no longer be kept captive to serve them alone the cultural empire of the usa is ripe to fall even as i write this and the indian empire has already fallen a thousand years ago india was the usa of the age not any more today this cultural empire has eroded until all we have left is a kind of cultural hubris and hubris  as we all know  is a fine quality often found in those who perish from itthe strength of indian civilization was always in its openness to new ideas and a willingness to put in the hard work to further those ideas today however  we have neither the openness to new ideas  nor the will to work hard take for example the resistance to westernization does it not speak of a reluctance to embrace new ideas and concepts? this hardening of opinions and closing of minds is prevalent not only in resisting outside influences and preserving indian culture  but also in every detail of our lives a teacher in india does not like it if his student questions him for in that question  lies the seed of a new idea and in that seed  lies the implication that the teacher may be wrong and that is why we indians do not like someone who asks too many questions  as i found out to my cost when i questioned indias supposed cultural superioritya far more dangerous symptom however  is our instinctive reluctance to work hard for what we want our instinctive impulse to take a shortcut our instinctive reflex to take the easy road here i come back to the opening statement of this essay the easy path leads to barbarism the tough to civilization the tough road is often a tedious path and in india  this road is often avoided in favour of the easy jugaad it is nothing but a shortcut and we as a nation  nay  as a civilization have become addicted to shortcuts and hence we have fallen everything in india can be resolved by a shortcut if you stand in a queue  there is always a tout who will be happy to help you jump the line for a fee instead of paying your taxes  it is far easier to just hide your income under your bed why wait for the light to change from red to green when there is no one crossing your path? why be orderly when you can be disorderly and get away with it? why work hard when you can steal from someone? why be polite when you do not have to be? why throw the garbage into the dustbin when someone is there to collect it from any spot in the city? i could go on and on everything in india has a shortcut and this culture of taking shortcuts has struck root in the very mindset of our society every single thing is now a shortcut jugaad why take the tougher road to civilization? why apply our minds when someone else can do it? it is easier to run away to the west than stay back and make this country worth living in why perform original research in india where you have to build your own apparatus  when you can just hop across the pond and perform that same research in the west  where that same apparatus can be bought off the shelf? why? why indeed? because  it is the short cut it is the easy path and it shall lead us to barbarism it is not an individual failing on the part of indians i will not blame any one person for this it is a failing of our society indeed  it is a historical inevitabilityhistorical inevitability? yes  our decline was inevitable every great civilization has declined when its culture of openness is replaced by closed minds and an aversion to questions look at islam a thousand year ago and today if at all anyone dares to interpret the quoran any way other than the accepted dogma  he is immediately met with a fatwa calling for his beheading western civilization has flourished and prospered precisely because it has cast off the yoke that is the catholic church and allowed free thought this freedom of thought does remain in india  but only in vestiges and as we have already seen  it is being gradually eroded it is historical inevitability the point is further clarified by a study of entropy entropy  in laymans terms  is a measure of the disorderliness in a system in any spontaneous process  entropy always increases so if we consider human history to be a spontaneous process  interspersed by periods where man has consciously tried to improve himself  it is not difficult to see how every rise is followed by a fall as i have already stated  taking the tougher road is an informed decision  while the easy path comes spontaneously every civilization at some point  will abandon the long tough road  to take the short cut and when a society starts taking shortcuts  it begins to decline every civilization has declined and so shall weand so we have declined our fall has only begun and we shall keep falling  for a long  long time is there nothing that can be done? i do not know the only thing that can be done is the administration of a shock treatment a shock treatment that so drastically affects us that we will be forced to change for the better the black death in the 14th century jolted europe and gave rise to the renaissance  which laid the foundation for the current dominance of western civilization kemal mustafa ataturks radical measures of westernization and his suppression of anything connected with the decadence of the ottoman empire  gave rise to modern turkey a nation that is a beacon of hope for the muslim world what kind of shock treatment can reverse the tide of indias decline? i do not know but the least we can do  is acknowledge that we have a problem and when you see the problem and the scale of it  it will give you the shock treatmenttl dr  we are in decline because our culture has lost its ability to question and innovate we also prefer shortcuts it is a historical inevitability and there is nothing we can do about it,howdy_rss,nan,2019-09-26 02:38:11

like ndrf or the pm relief fund im sure we have lots of funds for unforseen circumstances which have funds but can be used for this emergency especially with delhi becoming an epicentre after the tablighi fiasco leave all technicalities can someone tell me how is delhi supposed to operate without this fund? basically the question is why were these alternate mechanisms not used? great post u ringtring kejriwal has been moaning about not receiving funding to combat the crisis and this is a great post explaining why delhi was not allocated fundseither kejriwal does not know the reason  mentioned in the post  or is willingly not mentioning it to create a sense of bias against aap by the centre either way  he needs to get his facts right nice research with finance commission recommendationsbut the recommendations of the fc is advisory and hence not binding on the govt  so nothing like constitutional obligations also pm cares has a lot of fund now so it can be used straight away  so i feel the ball is in central govt court now to get funds for delhi and put the end to this issue and not politicise by playing around i think kejriwal is all in his rights to ask for fundshttp  wwwarthapediain indexphp?titlefinance_commission  deleted  what nonsense let me get the timeline straightbjp 2014 elect us delhi  we will give you statehoodbjp 2015 elect us delhi  we will give you statehoodaap 20152019 give us statehoodbjp noaap 2020 give us money for tackling a pandemic like every other statebjp sorry  you are not a statefuck off we are going through a freaking pandemic right nowto hell with all the bureaucracy and politics about delhi not being a statewe all know the real reason why delhi didnt receive aid thanks for research so it is more like we will make sure everyone suffers as we did not win the election?

no  she hasnt but she has tried for the first few years it seemed we were going back to 70s and 80s with a lot of promises made but nothing happening on ground but over the years  her effort has shown one of the major things she did right was to appoint some good capable professionals and politicians to important ministries like finance  industries  labour  agriculture  urban development and filling the rest with chamchas and career politicians as a result  economy  civic planning  tourism etc has seen excellent development in the past decade the biggest thing for me that i have seen is the patient planning  and the setting up of grounds before moving in with a major policyanother thing that gets lost in the minority appeasement rhetoric is the work that has been done for the tribals and indigenous peopleshe has also done excellent work for social welfare  especially for girls her kanyashree project  scholarship to girls from poor families  as long as they are not forcefully married before they are 18  and as long as they attend schools  along with a one time grant of 25000 rupees when the girl turns 18  has done wonders in bengal it has reduced child marriage and increased literacy amongst girls from backward communities in one go this scheme was even recognised by united nations as the best social development scheme in the developing world people dont talk enough about kanyashree  it is one of the best things to happen in bengal in my lifetimeis bengal doing great today? no  not at all theres still loads of problems that need to be addressedhas her rule been clean and corruption free? absolutely notis bengal free from political violence? again  nohas she done enough? probably notbut we are heading towards the right direction  albeit slowly bengal is not going to be prosperous overnight  there are loads and loads of issues  and she has successfully tackled quite a few of themoverall  i would say she has done more good than harm  which is not something you can say about most governments in indianote  kanyashree scheme for girls in bengal wins un award   https  wwwndtvcom indianews kanyashreeschemeforgirlsinbengalwinsunaward1716321 i actually believe mamata banerjee is amongst the best 2 cms of the state of all time after dr bidhan chandra ray every one else did far more harm for the state than goodalso  as seen above  she is the least evil of the 4 choices and she is clearly not a genocidal maniac like your beloved modi no genocidal maniac takes a bullet for whats rightas such  i am a fan of her even if she has done some questionable and bad things###ps what i left outhttps  economictimesindiatimescom news elections loksabha india whatmakesbengalpoliticssodifferentfromtherestofindia articleshow 68826757cms?frommdr its called syndicatein short after the partitions  the local panchayets and whats was left of zamindars along with some local muscles teamed up to form a power structure that dictated everything that happens locally they decided everything of their local area this system spread through out the stateafter bidhan chandra ray died  bangla congress  then named branch of bengal inc  basically took the leaders of such groups under their own party banner some of them were even given party tickets and actually  officially became leaders of their said areasjust before cpm came in power in 77  majority of these groups switched sides to cpm and became cpm cadres as they were called  note cpm actually actively discouraged caste politics and encouraged class politics and made these groups follow it  which is why caste politics is not prevalent in bengal despite heavy casteism same said groups switched sides to tmc in 2011 before they won and then they came to be known as syndicateits very much clear that whichever party holds these tiny power groups are actually able to become the state rulers,ProfessorFreeza, unfortunately 9 years is too short a time to right what happened over the past 60 yearssame excuse the bhakths giving for modii like your interesting take on mamata where youve conveniently ignored the following1 corruption  only mamata bhakths believe that she and her party members had nothing to do with the sarada scam or the other chit funds the cases are still pending and the money is totally gone whatever money was returned to the few was taken out from the state funds a bridge collapsed in the middle of city and tmc government didnt bat an eye trifala scam has started again theres too many to list here  but do check what abhishek banerjee has been doing for the last few years 2 intolerance  calling students maoists and arresting them arresting professors and putting them behind bars without fair trial for posting a simple meme police violence in ju torturing civil service officers to suicide 3 lies and jumla  park street rape case the accused escaped and his gf who aided his escape was taken into the party mamata assassinated the character of the rape victim just to give a clean chit to the accused everyone forgot that it seems in this regard  care to elaborate whats shes doing with the covid 19 testing to hide the numbers? social media is rife with tells of how people are being turned away from hospitals  and thats not bjp propaganda im receiving news from my friends who are doctors that theres state sponsored propaganda to hide the numbers mamata even went as far to forcefully audit the deaths to comorbid conditions so that the covid report can be suppressed funny thing is  unless theres comorbid conditions  youll not even die from covid  that doesnt mean its not spreading4 industrial output  pray tell what mamata has done to improve the states industrial output? where are the jobs? weve all been hearing the empty lies from the biswa bangla summit  how many of the those projects ever came to fruition?5 minority appeasement  while modi is trying to get rid of muslims  mamata is doing the opposite  going as far as to ignore the criminal elements in the society to pander to that votebank the attack on doctors that sparked a protest across the country was fueled by the simple fact that mamata didnt have the guts to arrest the criminals because they were muslims  even when the rational bengali muslim community tried denouncing them over and over she has given the statement that those who came from bangladesh and have voted are now citizens even if they have come recently  what the fuck? mamata doesnt get to decide who gets citizenship we dont want bangladeshis here  no matter if they are hindu or muslim her government had even shielded war crime convicts just to get some brownie points why?theres no difference between modi and mamata except the fact that while the first one is trying to get rid of the muslims  the second one was trying to alleviate them to a godlike status  one imam from a bengali masjid gave the statement a few years ago that the muslims will decide who gets to become the cm of wb  other than that  the lies and jumla are just as widespread  the corruption just as deep the only reason mamata gets away with all this is because bengal has became irrelevant in the national stage no one gives a shit else shes just as corrupt and authoritarian as modi and if talking about the developments  these are all being done with a single strategy destroy bengals industrial output  evict all the educated folks  so whoever left becomes solely dependant on the state for their livelihood meanwhile she and her goons can continue ruling the state like the left has done for last 3 decades thats all there is to itbengalis have no hope left its tmc or bjp  and both are cancerous in their own ways only chance is for an arvind kejriwal to rise  but thats probably never gonna happen most educated and literate bengalis are leaving the state  whos gonna rise to the occasion? there should be a trade off between socialism and capitalismsomething in between so everyone can benefit  deleted  nice writeup bro hows the popularity of bjp among bengalis ? i heard they are gaining ground in some spots and local polls  do you think communists supporting the bjp will affect tmc much ? okey lets list pros and cons of mamata and tmcpros 1  mamata is authoritarian but still tmc regime is way more free than the previous cpm rule it was possible to openly post against tmc in social media such open criticism of the government or party was impossible for most people earlier2  rural infrastructure is developed a lot in comparison to previous regime roads are improved a lot3  the police and the government offices are more active4  smaller crimes like eve teasing and theft are reduced in my experience5  the government and the party is secular and not racist  at all which is a big plus point in todays india6  economy of the state is improved7  government officials and police has more power than the previous regime where they were puppets of the local party officecons 1  one woman party and government due to her tendency to control everything her government is full with people who are good for nothing and totally useless she doesnt like people who would argue with her2  her intolerance against opposition3  tmc is full with goons and politicians whose sole aim is to make money by hook or crook4  appeasement of big groups of people for vote yes  not only muslims  she tried to appease every groups who are united enough the all india media do not show her appeasement of hindu matua people who are a big votebank she tried to appease both mullahs and brahmin pandits by offering them money she also gave money to clubs and durga pujas5  various scams like sharada  trifala etc6  state government employees are angry with her due to  not giving da and other allowances at par with the central7  reduction of government employments and some questionable recruitmentsverdicttmc is still better than bengal bjp which is openly anti muslim  anti science  anti intellectual pro fake news and anti bengali good write up  mogambo khush huya  removed ,2020-04-19 22:52:34

Business/Finance,its lock on for indian real estate,5,fxmvof,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fxmvof/its_lock_on_for_indian_real_estate/,15,  lock  on means disambiguation which refers to the removal of ambiguity by making something clearwe never wouldve imagined a day when 1 3rd of worlds population would be in a lockdown while the wrath of the lockdown has totally changed our lives  putting our work and finances in a jeopardy  our future will depend largely on how we utilize the time available today the lockdown gives us ample of time to ponder upon key decisions taken and to be taken  explore avenues for reviving the finances  make mindful investments and rectify the unpreparedness with which we are facing todays situation make a choice now  whether you want to repent over what went wrong or make lemonade out of the lemons life  or the virus  has thrown upon us if you choose the latter  then this article is for you to read ahead this pandemic has rightly taught us that uncertainties come unexpectedly how prepared are we to face an adverse situation again?businesses are adversely hit and job security has gone for a toss  leaving us in a catch 20 situation talking about investments  the fds  stocks  shares that we invested in are witnessing negative returns our priced possessions like jewelry and gold are locked up in banks and not helping us get through the situation fancy cars are stationed in parking lots  unused the alternate investment options like sips  mutual funds too arent performing remarkably  one thing that has stood between us and the disaster is home a sense of safety and security that a home brings for a family is irreplaceable it is a physical as well as an emotional comfort zone where one heals and recuperates through tough times man  right from the stone age has been wandering in search of a home  caves   to protect himself  establish a family  dwell in and flourish a critical question arising out of the covid19 scenario is what will be the fate of home buying and real estate post the lockdown?studies and reports suggest that the real estate sector will decline  witnessing the worst hit till date and survival will be a challenge however  as said by benjamin franklin  out of adversity comes opportunity the sector also flashes rays of positivity and you would be intrigued to know about the potential to invest in real estate  against all the current odds real estate will be the most reliable investment option  considering the conditions of banks  share market crash and capital depreciation or any other option that may appear to be safe initiallywhy will the indian real estate sector grow faster than that of the world?1 the world economy will go into recession this year with a predicted loss of trillions of dollars of global income due to the coronavirus pandemic  spelling serious trouble for developing countries  with the likely exception of india and china  according to a latest un trade report2 the virus pushes uschinese relationship towards fracture  the fallout from the global pandemic threatens the recent uschinese trade deal and could undermine future global stability this rift will lead india to gain interests of global investors and companies these investments open doors for better infrastructure  leading to the opening of multiple employment opportunities these factors directly balm the upward movement of real estate in india3 china lost its goodwill and trust from investors and the corporate world  owing to the     rumored  conspiracies in the way the country handled the spread of covid 19 to the world after china  india is the only country with the capacity to handle the magnitude of the global scale  in terms of manpower  resources  transport systems  etc4 india so far  has augmented trust in handling corona and has bravely fought pandemics in the past too indian real estate gains appreciation form world economists for its perception as a nation

lucrative hotspot of real estate investments  below are few points to consider towards real estate buying  emotional investment in india  owning a home is a matter of pride and esteem the sentiment

whatever be the circumstances people across the world will not stop investing in a home or buying real estate statistics the indian real estate growth trajectory  since the past few years was likely to emerge stronger and is projected to be usd 650 bn by 2025 and usd 1 000 bn by 2030 residential  commercial and retail are the three key asset classes  which have primarily been contributing to the sectors growth real estate contributed nearly 6 to indias gdp in 2017 as per the projected growth trends  the sectors contribution is likely to rise to 13 of indias gdp by 2025 real estate  largest employment generator after agriculture  real estate is the largest employment generator in the country  creating tremendous opportunities for the skilled and unskilled workforce indias real estate employee base is estimated to be 67 mn by 2022 high tangible asset value real estate is not paper money  this is the asset you can hold tangibly which again increases its reliability and return on investment competitive risk adjustment returns  based on july 2018 data from national council of real estate investment fiduciaries  ncreif   private market commercial real estate returned an average of 985 over the past five years this credible performance was achieved  together with low volatility relative to equities and bonds  for highly competitive riskadjustment returns  attractive and stable income return  specially in commercial space  the rental yield from real estate is much higher than returns on any traditional sources of investment commercial investment can yield upto 12 roi and lowest to 5 roi  with capital appreciation  depending upon the construction stage and lease terms of the property inflation hedging the inflation hedging capability of real estate stems from the positive relationship between gdp growth and demand for real estate as economies expand  the demand for real estate derives rents higher and this  in turn  translates into higher capital values long term assured wealth building asset with predictable  returns and least risk  real estate helps you build wealth in long term due to dual advantage of regular predictable returns  yield is higher than dividend returns  and an assured capital appreciation in long term  dont be scared of corporate scams  while they can affect the companys stock price or your banks health  but it cannot junk out the value of real estate you own  helps you raise money quickly  hard asset is the most preferred collateral for a bank  to raise capital through a loan  lap lrd  your property is the best asset you could

benefits of redevelopment wherein due to ever increasing fsi norms of mmr the incoming developer would not only offer rent for transit accommodation and corpus as hardship allowance  but also offer at least 25 to 30 enhanced area  which is of great value as remember  1 sqft of real estate in central mumbai is valued more than 10 gram of gold   work from home culture we are in the middle of the largest test of homeworking in history and corporates are adopting  refining and testing policies  processes and infrastructure to make it work we expect quarantine protocols to encourage workfromhome initiatives and for these practices to be adopted in new geographies as the contagion spreads large multinationals who recently  and publicly  announced the scaling back of homeworking practices now indicate a desire to embrace widespread use of this practice until the outbreak passes so commercial demands and coworking space or bigger house may increase student housing an unusual market development that is gradually emerging is student housing in india real estate consultancy firm  anarock property consultants says that of the 37 million students pursuing higher education in india

investment avenue not only for institutional investors but also for retail investors  who find it difficult to invest in the commercial real estate  which has a better rent yielding than residential properties unlike other equity investments  reits provide assured returns to the investors through a compulsory dividend distribution policy reits are mandated to distribute 90 of their net distributable income as dividend there is also a further upside potential for the investors from periodic property valuations indias first listed reit  has gained 50 since listing in march 2019 as

indeed creditworthy these are expected to yield fruitful results in the future and help establish indian real estate as a preferred destination for global investors  occupiers  and homebuyerswhy real estate during lockdown?probably most of the people interested in buying real estate would be holding their decision till the lock down opens due to speculations in the market or risk pertaining to economic conditions yet for any clever investor who is observing the current market will testify buying of real estate during lock down to be the smartest move here is why 1 reduction in home loan rates on 27 march 2020  the reserve bank of india  rbi  reduced the repo rate by 75 basis points  bps  the reduction saw the repo rate reduce from 515 to 440 new home loan rates start at 8 from 1 march 2020 so indeed this is good time to buy your home if the decision was just hiding behind the corner for some better rates or good units2 low demand  value for money real estate is facing deficit demand in the market which leads to generation of various attractive offers by developers to maintain the good books  builders are currently offering very low rates  lucrative payment plans and additional offers resulting in lowering the cost of property enduser can expect to buy a property as low as the launch price during this lock down3 reduction in stamp duty the maharashtra government on march 6 announced that it is reducing stamp duty on properties by 1 for mumbai  mmrda region and pune for a period of two years4 passive income various small investment options are being introduced in the market starting as low as 5 lacs in real estate that too with a rental income this is again an opportunity to create a separate asset class in your portfolio and start a source of passive income5 demand supply breakthrough due to low demand  discounted rates on good inventories are available but once the economic condition will start settling  the bargain will reduce and demand will also start floating upwards the rates will not be as low as they are now during lock down6 segment shift  earlier lower middle class people used to buy 10 to 12 lakh property now middle class will buy those as an investor and rent it out to lower middle income group similarly shift will take place on affordable segment likewise middle income group will emerge as new investor community7 strike the iron when it is hot we all must have heard this at least once but its time to implement the strategy to gain extensive returns on the investment not only the rates are strikingly low  the return on investment that are being offered by some developers is as high as 1518final thoughts your money is safe in indian real estate regulator like maharera leading the cause of timely justice   high court judiciary being extremely proactive and proconsumer   investor   nclt giving prompt hearings and orders favoring customer and financial institution and lastly  the supreme court judgment reaffirms the rights of the homebuyers as financial creditors under the bankruptcy code simply put  it means that homebuyers share equal rights of recovery in the developers assets which are liquidated as part of the bankruptcy processthe bottom linereal estate cannot be lost or stolen  nor can it be carried away  purchased with common sense  paid in full  and managed with reasonable care   it is about the safest investment in the worldreal estate is a distinct asset class that is simple to understand and can enhance the risk and return profile of an investors portfolio on its own  real estate offers competitive riskadjusted returns  with less principalagent conflict and attractive income streams though illliquidity can be a concern for some investors  there are ways to gain exposure to real estate yet reduce illliquidity and even bring it onpar with that of traditional asset classes real estate investing even on a small scale  remains a tried and true means of building an individuals cash flow and wealthbuy real estate in areas where the path exists   and buy more real estate where there is no path  but you can create your own dont wait to buy real estate   buy real estate and

okay cigarettes are 45 a piece here cant afford groceries if the lockdown goes on for another month sure  suggest us to buy cheap properties fucking real estate assholes to a hammer every problem looks like it can be fixed by a nail fact of the matter is real estate is a bad investment in india you may buy a house if you wish to live in it however as an investment vehicle with pitiful rental yields of 23 due to over supply in most cities  it is a renters marketbuying land on the outskirts where the city will grow into is a much better investment compared to buying built real estate real estate shoule be the last thing one should be investing in   in the next 1215 months1 rental yields from a rented home would barely be enough to cover the emi of a housing loan   let alone act as a secondary source of income   im2 houses are highly illiquid investments with the kind of job losses predicted over the next 1215 months   one needs or have a solid savings pool to be easily accessible if there are no takers for your house   you will have virtually no  liquidity on hand to provide for emergency expenditures   mom and dad falling ill  deferred jobs for your sons and daughters   layoffs for you etc   3 post corona   the reverse migration that has happened will not see most migrants returning any time soon most villages are self sufficient and labor migrates for better opportunities to cities there will be  scant opportunities  post corona recovery and labour shortages will not be accompanied by commensurate wage increase as real estate firms will not be able to afford higher project outflows for labour so expect massive delays on projects that are under construction  a large number of real estate firms will wind up quite a few will be stuck in litigation  you money may be stuck and you may never even see an asset we are going through a highly irregular time this is not a good time for such stupid investment decisions psa  stay away from this wall of

owning 11 of hdfc gets china no say in any matter related to hdfc yet china owns huge  of indian startups and thus can exert control on these companies  as well as access data of indians 2 what kind of thought was put into this decision? its clear that finance ministry doesnt put much thought into most of its policies  as evidenced by the downward spiral of economy and key finance ministry portfolio holders more interested in goli maro than economy  but is killing startups during an already fast growing global pandemic crisis really required? 3 what kind of relief will india provide to its startups? indian govt coffers are already running on fumes just to deal with coronavirus disaster  billions of dollars would have to be spent by the govt that will leave little room for other reliefs infact the only way govt can survive is by taxing already tax payers even further in this situation  is indian govt equipped to provide any relief to startups?many indians have been celebrating the news of banning chinese investments as if this is good news for the country no it is not it is stupid  unplanned and achieves no real purpose huge indian listed companies like hdfc cannot be taken over by china so easily  while china already has lot of control on indian startups  due to existing investments govt could have smartly brought about antitakeover laws instead of outright banning all chinese investments instead this govt has shown its foolishness again  and with scant thought has enacted a rule that will spray gasoline on an already burning economy without any thought  the ban button has been pressed yet again the same ban button that has become modis favourite  for all situations,ShortTesla_Rekt5, china is a snake dressed as a puppy best blocked look how the ccp is protesting now saying that indias protections violate the wto rules where were the wto rules when lakhs of crores worth of state sponsorship was given to ccp companies to dump products everywhere at prices lower than the raw material costs  simply to kill the domestic manufacturers? you cannot even get a diwali lamp thats made in india these days  and it is because local makers cannot compete with the state subsidized manufacturing and dumping by china honestly  if a startup is really good  money will flow in from everywhere companies like paytm are not real innovations they are data mining operations great startups have marquee investors from us  singapore  korea etc we dont need china they have taken over companies all across eu and australia they sneak in  then buy it completely  paytm to zomato  byjus  makemytrip  swiggy ola  big basket these companies are hardly innovative and just do the middleman business but online too much vc money is not good for whole business ecosystem these companies are subsidizing to create mono duopoly  and crushing down the other competing domestic startups we dont want that  why did mere 02 additional investment in hdfc trigger the govt so much? hdfc is a  systemically important bank  https  enwikipediaorg wiki systemically_important_financial_institution  in short  a bank  insurance company  or other financial institution whose failure might trigger a financial crisis they are colloquially referred to as too big to fail owning every  of hdfc is like owning a part of indian economy  so obviously indian govt will loose their shit if china invest more in this company  indian startups are among the most innovative companies in the world  and have recorded huge growth despite negligible assistance from the modi governmentdude  what the hell are you smoking? indian startups are mere copycats of western businesses flipkart copied amazon  ola copied uber  oyo copied airbnb  paytm copied paypal  zomato copied yelp  the list goes on 1 why did mere 02 additional investment in hdfc trigger the govt so much? owning 11 of hdfc gets china no say in any matter related to hdfchdfc ltd is a lending company with deep ties to the banking sector even a 1 stake lets them get into the board  and they get veto powers a ccpowned firm having veto powers in one of the largest banking organizations of the country? no  thanks 2 what kind of thought was put into this decision? its clear that finance ministry doesnt put much thought into most of its policies  as evidenced by the downward spiral of economy and key finance ministry portfolio holders more interested in goli maro than economy  but is killing startups during an already fast growing global pandemic crisis really required?while i agree that the finance ministry is daft in regards to various policy matters since it is controlled by the pmo  a veto against china wont kill startups what kills startups are their lack of revenue management almost all startups are running in losses how long will financers back these companies? businesses exist to generate profit  yet most modern startups dont have those plans in sight  both indian and foreign startups as well  3 what kind of relief will india provide to its startups? indian govt coffers are already running on fumes just to deal with coronavirus disaster  billions of dollars would have to be spent by the govt that will leave little room for other reliefs infact the only way govt can survive is by taxing already tax payers even further in this situation  is indian govt equipped to provide any relief to startups?why should government systems provide financial aid to companies  both startups as well as established businesses? that whole line of thinking is wrong in my opinion unfortunately  the worst precedent was set when government bailed out banks during the 2008 financial crisis yes  businesses have been hurt by covid19  and a lot of them have incurred losses as well isnt it part of running a busines? if startups dont learn to not put all their eggs in one basket  the government cannot help it the most a government can do  and i am not talking bjp   congress here  is relax taxation and bureaucratic mess of paperwork to ease startups to get back to their feet i dont think india has banned investments they just made it mandatory to seek government approval before its doneif china is pissed they can take it up theirsyou just need to look at australia  if you want to see what giving china free rein could mean in a tough situation what are the anti takeover laws you are talking about? do you have an example of any country implementing it successfully? not in a harsh tone  just curious i do not understand why everyone thinks they are financial experts and the people running the country with advisors who are some of the best experts in their fields are all idiotsas for answering your question  you have to think bigger and broader than just startups  as an effect of coronavirus there is going to be a recession and most industries would be going into red  so as to avoid hostile takeovers and keep the industries safe the decision was takenyou should open your mentality a little broader and read about what china has done in maldives and how much debt maldives is in right now you can also google about what china is doing in africainstead of appreciating when the country actually takes steps to protect its national interests and assets here you are deriding it and favouring china i am truly speechless you are not a financial expert  your post shows that  + will advise to read a bit about indias diplomatic relations and how international trade works + listen to experts views on the same  varied views   now you can form a opinion  if you want to  where did you get your degree in economics?,2020-04-21 02:18:54
Business/Finance,heres my side of the story as a small businessman,28,fw7gcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fw7gcl/heres_my_side_of_the_story_as_a_small_businessman/,6,this is going to be long i would really appreciate it if you can read this fully thank you for your attention in advance im not sure what to flair this post as im on a throwaway account that i may or may not continue using and i just want to share my side of the story while i sit here in loneliness watching random videos on youtube just to get my mind off of things and with no sign of sleep at allabout me  my partnersim a late 20s guy who quit his job two years ago and went ahead and jumped into the indian startup ecosystem to start my business im also a college dropout by choice so i dont have a graduate degree but i really loved the business we were running me along with two of the bestest friends were my partners and i feel responsible for them one of them quit his safe cushy job when i messaged him at 2am in the morning with my idea and the other one trusted me enough to fund this whole machine im extremely lucky to have these people in my life and i acknowledge thatour business  what we doour business isnt one of those apps or tech related business were more into the supply chain and making product sourcing and fulfillment for people in the ecommerce sphere easy think of it in a way that im sourcing and exporting products that my clients sell on their ecom sites i loved this because this is something that solved a problem for my own hobby turning it into a fullfledged business and it was also helping me create a legit machine with a brand name that also helped me capture clientshow has the lockdown affected my business?being a new business we were almost breakeven most of the money we were losing was because of bad decisions and mistakes but everyday we were losing less also had a bunch of profitable days and weeks which helped us not invest more from our own pockets into the business we had created a cycle where the money that came in helped us with all the costsme along with the partner who had invested money into the business were not taking out salaries  reason why i said almost breakeven  and i was making sure that the third partner got paid because he left his good job and to assure his family members  remember  were all in our late 20s we had also hired some help to help us in the office and with the vendors that we were dealing with basically the plan was to spend only when absolutely necessary and while doing it this way we also made sure that we had a life outside of workthis worked smoothly with some hitches of coursein january when i read about the first covid19 case in india  i was scared things got bad real soon around the world with every passing day i was worried more and more about what i was going to do in case our country went into a complete lockdown i checked and tried to do some analysis in order to see if we can still work it if we do go into the lockdownbut the fact of the matter is that my business heavily depends on vendors and shipping providers and the latter is out of my control and reach the main part of this whole thing was shipping which i had taken so much pain to setupone thing i learned while doing all this is that theres a reason why india with such manpower and about mediocre infra in our industry isnt able to fulfill even a fraction of the demand its because the vendors are lazy even if you promise to pay them above the market rate  make payments on time and even help them financially to source the raw materials  they are not willing to work for it and im not talking about overtime or anything just their normal work cycle they are not serious about it at alli had multiple vendors but only one of them worked properly and listened to me when there was an urgency in the order we were giving them we had this second vendor who just wasnt serious about the work and we were giving them loads of work within a month i was their biggest client and they did work properly for the first two months but after that it all went to shit i couldnt change my vendor because thats a long process of renegotiating and setting everything up which i couldnt do in my volumes which were highi wrote all this because when my city got the first few covid19 cases  i started urging them to get my work done as soon as possible we were given assurances  promises  we paid in advance but it all went to shit because now i have an inventory of products that is ready to go but i cannot send them due to the state borders being closed my shipping company is not able to function and all these need to be sent out of indiaim now in a sea of uncertainty where i have to pay my bills  pay my office rent  pay salaries with whatever i have in the business account right nowthe financesim not even worried about the money  im worried about the inventory i have  im worried about the payment disputes i need to deal with because these are all orders to be sent outside india for every payment dispute i lose  i lose 15 extra the money for the customer acquisition cost is already paid for the money for the raw materials are to be paid and im refunding customers everyday losing that customer acquisition amount along with any margin that i might have earnedwhat do i mean exactly? now  im all for lifemoney but as a small businessman who has been thinking  living  breathing his business all the time for months and years  im going insane im having panic attacks  i dont know what i will do next i used to have a plan for everything  now i dont im not able to let this go and this pain is almost physical now my head hurts all the time  i sleep for a few hours and when i wake up my eyes are still red and they feel as if theyre burningim also sure that there are businesses out there that are into deeper shit than i am but that in my own opinion shouldnt be a comfort for me im not sadistici have no savings  my company is running out of money  there are people who need to be paid  employees to pay and a partner who invested with trust and is now seeing the money disappear into thin air daily  hes a kind soul and hasnt said a single word for it yetbut i feel responsible and im not able to calm down anxiety is on its peak for me right now and i have no plans to save us from thisi come to this sub daily and i actively participate in discussions and disses but i havent seen anything about small business people here and just wanted to tell my side of the storyim scared guys  im not even religious and can just hope that the govt probably is thinking of exporters in this scenario to maybe help us in this situationim wishing you all good health and please stay insideim going to try and sleep now thank you for reading this,doomedbijnissman, i do hope you have a force majure clause in your fulfillment policy this would protect you from any fall out as things arent in your control this is a unique situation where no one has control over anything  whether they are an employer or employee also   working with indian clients can be a pain in the arse as like you said  they dont pay enough attention to work  inefficiencies are high  there are leaks within the workflow process the system is far from decent  let alone perfect i feel it is a cultural thing more than anything elsefrom one small bujiness man to another  let the dust settle you cannot do anything now since nothing is in your control talk to your vendors and customers make sure there are sufficient open communication channels to ensure that they know your position and you know theirs this would immensely help you to get back on your feet quicker once youre aware of the issues youll have to deal with once things open upyou also have a lot of free time since theres no activity work on yourself and your company now look inwards take assessment of your processes  see where you can improve workflow  focus on efficiency with not much happening in the world  this is an excellent time to introspect since we wouldnt get time otherwise when things are busy  without disrupting operations i would also use this time to contact vendors who are of the same wavelength as you youre only as good as your team if youre taking the extra step with your vendor to ensure your operations arent affected  youre more likely helping him and not yourself it isnt your job to make sure he does his so that you get what youre paying for  use this free time to search and assess vendors who take their commitments seriously as much as you do make some phone calls  talk to people and get a feel of their product orservices you can also use this time to negotiate and do some ground level work this would iron out all the problems youre facing with your current vendors once the lock down is overfeel free to dm i love to talk to fellow businessmen   i dont have any advice that would help you i just wanna say  be strong this too shall pass stay in there buddy  youre young and that fire will bring you out whatever happens  dont quit  difficult times bro stay strong a few questions1 is your inventory perishable?2 cant it be sold domestically?3 not sure if this question is even correct  is it possible to go into a hibernation mode and then restart the business when things are better?4 are your customers in a position to wait for things to improve and accept delayed deliveries? you sound like a survivor  dude youll noah this one out  pukka bro code says  you and your friends will be fine,2020-04-07 10:59:46

openaccess journal emerging microbes and infections has cautioned that sarscov2  the virus causing the covid19 outbreak  is being shed through multiple routes  so testing through oral swabs alone might not be sufficient a paper by wei zhang  et al  all from the cas key laboratory of special pathogens at the wuhan institute of virology  says investigations on patients in a local hospital infected with the virus revealed the presence of sarscov2 in anal swabs and blood as well whats more  more anal swabs than oral swabs tested positive at a later stage of infection since covid19 is believed to be a disease of the respiratory tract  usually only oral swabs are used for diagnosis  and discharge is based on the oral swabs testing negative the anal positives suggested  they argued  shedding through the oral fecal route  and therefore transmission is possible as well the researchers also showed that a serology test  testing blood for antibodies  can improve detection positive rate  and thus should be used in the future as part of the research  samples  including oral swabs  anal swabs and blood were collected by wuhan pulmonary hospital two investigations were performed the paper describes  in the first investigation  samples were taken from 39 patients  7 of whom were in a severe condition in the second investigation  samples were lifted from 139 patients  whose clinical records were not available when counting all swab positives together  we found most of the positives came from oral swab  8 10  80  on day 0 however  this trend appears to change on day 5 we found more  6 8  75  anal swab positive than oral swab positive  4 8  50  the data suggested a shift from more oral positives during the early period to more anal positives during the later period the current strategy for the detection of viral rna in oral swabs used for 2019ncov diagnosis is not perfect the virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative this observation implies that a patient cannot be discharged purely based on oral swabs testing negative  and the researchers go on to make a recommendation to do serological tests to confirm the status#### about coronavirusescoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that may cause illness in animals or humans in humans  several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging

Business/Finance,help how do i stop my dad from squandering away his savings?,121,dwnioc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dwnioc/help_how_do_i_stop_my_dad_from_squandering_away/,43,backgroundmy dad retired 2 years back from a government organization where he did not have a pension scheme he has saved 25l or so over the years to sustain for himself he has had thoughts for opening a playschool because he wanted to do something in education noble idea? yes but he does not have any background in education teaching etc and understanding how schools are run more importantly  the problem is that my dadunfortunately  lacks business acumen and is very trusting of people he tried to have a franchise with one company  signed a contract  and lost 1l there that the company refused to return this was done without much consultation with me  where i could have at least tried to look into this and prevent it  next  he aligned with another school and took their franchise and has spent 8l till date  running at a significant loss i also have 2 elder brothers but they are not very supportive in terms of finance or else we all are living in different cities  they in mumbai  i am in delhi  parents are in up  my sisterinlaw did step in as school coordinator initially but found a teaching gig  right step imo  elsewhere soonafter year to date  there are only 5 children with 2 teachers who mostly sit whole day my dad acts as school coordinator current situationlately  he argues that he will open school in own home by using the part of the building that is being rented out  school is being run in a rented out building  he also expects me to support him financially despite my multitude of warnings  ignoring number of suggestions i made etc to put cherry on the cake  i came across a profile of an experienced school coordinator which i suggested to my dad so that she can lead this but he rejected it because she was muslim  which wasnt something i expected of my dadbut thats another story my concern stems from the fact that this is a deep hole my dad is sinking himself into in terms of expenses this is worrying for me because i have started job just 2 years back and expect itd be at least 34 years before i am in a position where i can help him out a bit additionally  the current tenant has has are pretty good + it offers a recurring cashflow in terms of his savingsmy take on this is that if he wants to focus on education  why not simply open a scholarship scheme or suppport some decent schools for underpriviliged kids? while there is no upside to this financially  the amount can be fixed and it is far better use of the money imo tldr dad burning money in an educational venture how do i stop this?,Vibgyor_5, get a trusted relative or a close friend of him and ask them to explain all what you said to your father i mean get someone who is true wellwisher of your dad and is someone who your father listens to your dad only reason for opening school is to gain social influence among his peers and community i dont think he will stop this madness until he is starved of his savings if he was so concerned about kids   he would have funded underprivileged children education rather than starting a school just make sure he doesnt start contacting any european women while hes at it i dont understand this you dad wants to start a school? or does he want to teach?each of them are very different adventures  have you tried to find out what is motivating him to start the school?  show him some examples of the risk associated with running a play school especially the legal risk  that could be deterrent to some  assume he doesnt have other fallback options  financial  for his own care  medical expenses  then highlight that too considering that your father has had considerable expertise in some field in the govt sector  why not redirect him to a start a consulting firm in his core area of expertise? there are still area where experience matters  especially in govt sector dont support him financially right now  because youll just be enabling him besides when he goes broke  youll be one who they turn to show him mota bhais photo to be honest it sounds like he wont listen to you i would suggest1  try to talk to him using numbers  charts  as someone suggested2  speak to your brothers  get them to understand the financial risk  and get them to commit to supporting your dad when he loses all his savings3  when the above dont work  speak sternly to your dad tell him youll limit the money youll give him when he burns through his prepare for everyone to get pissed off at youunfortunately its your financial future at stake everyone is going to throw kulcha in your face be prepared for this to become a big stink  and for him to lose all his money and for you to have to support him for the rest of his life anyway but at least you would have tried  and can tell him and your siblings you told them so when they ask you to give up 40 of your income looking after him if your dad wants to open a professional school take him to see how one functionsafter govt job in up he may have very different expectations of how work happensseeing a functioning one would give him context and feel for the entire project instead of stubbornly dithering in the dark  if your dad just wants prestige he thinks he deserves cause of govt job but didnt get after retirement and is trying to manufacture said by throwing money around abandon ship he has to come to terms with fact that the time to throw money around has passed i can think of two things either convince your dad or reduce his liquidityyour mother tried to talk with him? what is her stand? can she convince your father to put at least some money in her name in non flexible instruments like nsc  ppf or tax free bonds  gold  small peice of land?would it be helpful to visit to a financial counselor who can point out how little 15 25 lakh is to spend retired life?would it be a good idea to convince him to be associated with an educational institute for a couple of years and learn tricks of the trade?would he be willing to be associated with a ngo that works in field of education?can you try to talk to engage him with other people who tried education business but failed?if everything fails  i think you should make it very clear that you will not support him financially whether you do so or not is a choice that you can make in future tread carefully on this last one it will surely break his heart you also risk to loose inheritance i am just hoping that this will give him a shock and may be he will consider what he is doing ask him to take up full time parttime teaching job in some govt school no risk  impart knowledge  earn some pocket change and keeps him occupied let him burn it and when he is dependable on you  ruin his life witb many i told you soson a serious note  play school is not a very good venture to put your money in currently and its gonna br very hard to push towards profit and needs a lot of effort so slowly do some research and shift it in your dads house buy out a share and be a 50 partner  talk like a businessman and tell him now you would handle itthen hire that coordinator and just give your dad a share and tell him to relaxbut make sure someone your dad listens to passes on all this to him  your dad seems to be one of those people who never listen to their kids this is a general issue with indian parents they raise children as investments and expect returns from them when the children become capable  else you get labelled as nalayak or kamini aulaad by the society  they dont care about saving for the future  or about how theyll get money when it runs out  since youre always going to be there when things get hard its one of the pitfalls of a closelyknit rather than individualistic culture  but thats the discussion for another day i and my brother are going to be very set financially i have an awesome job with amazing pay and my brother is in a very good college and is generally pretty good at what he does however  i already warned my parents to not see us as investments which will generate returns and rather save for your retirement im still going to help them if things get bad  but it wont be because they managed money poorly as a result  theyve started saving and investing money for themselves and arent speculating real estate anymorei think you also need to do the same ask him how does he think hell survive once his saving runs out if he has a plan  good if he doesnt  make it clear that you wont help as youve got your mouth full in a bad economy make this very  very clear he needs to be fucking adraid if he still manages to get into a bad spot financially due to external factors  help him obviously but this should stop him from squandering moneyif he wants to be nobel and wants to help  tell him to teach people at home for free or volunteer for free at a school or ngo nearby theres a lot of help people can do with time rather than money why you do this op quit your job and help out your enterprising dad you are lucky to have a dad who has this entrepreneurial spirit bc  you should help him reach his goal this is the major problem with indian society you dont support people who start a business you need to help him attain this goal a man at that age is having ambition is a rare occurrence its tells that he will have character and commitment i dont understand why you judge that he wont succeed you need to believe in him and his goal he will do great   help him do great as an entrepreneur this is my piece of mind,2019-11-15 21:21:14

as in bjps removal through elections? or is it likely all bloodbath and genocide from here on culminating in civil wars and perhaps even foreign interference as much as i agree with the spirit of this post  i completely disagree with the substance  or rather  your interpretation of indiathis isnt about _ghar wapsi_ or about modi or  indeed  the bjp  scum though they are  this is about the creation of india as a political entity since before 1947 you see  its this bit and we certainly disagree on the definition of a nation hindu rashtra and hindu nationalism violate the constitution and turning india into a theocracy like iran is what modi and shah and the sangh parivar machinery wants to do can modi say under oath that he does not want to convert india into hindu rashtra? can the bhakts say so?the constitution is only valid so long as the people of the country choose to hold it as valid pieces of paper have no power or sovereignty  they derive sovereignty from the people the people have chosen to reject the constitution  because heres the kicker  the constitution and india are  and have always been  an inherently instable construct the ideas of a secular india has always been deeply antithetical precisely because india is _not_ a nation by any rational definition of a nation india is a hastily cobbledtogether postcolonial creation that validates itself solely by creating an enemy  first the british empire  justifiably so  and then pakistan  unjustifiable  and bangladesh  horrendously cruel it is these chickens that are  today  coming home to roost  because indias latent hindutva was incredible easy to exploit it always existed  it just lacked someone to point it out and now that people are told that their hindutva is threatened  the only justification they have always given themselves for the existence of their nation is collapsing  and they will shred the institutions meant to keep democracy safe just to keep their hindu project safeindia should never happened  the country was a postcolonial error  britains final kick to south asia  and pretending it could ever be a secular country was a mistake secular nations are built on tangible cultures and cultural beliefs with concrete identities  like european nations  or indian states india was always hindutva  and hindutva was always india  all it lacked was the spark to set fire to the hatred and xenophobia that always existed  because that hatred is what justifies indias existencetear the republic down and demand statehood for your state  which is currently subjugated by india and indianness sovereignty derives from a mandate of people living in consensus  and india will never have consensus that isnt phony and manufactured that is the only way you can guarantee a better future for those not particularly religiously inclined the idea of a nation is based on commonality of languageculture we preach unity in diversity and at the same time we also preach others to be indian first these 2 messages are contradictory  why do we have to forgo our cultural identities to be an indian if being indian is just embracing the diversity?   therein lies the real problem  the so called national politics is stuck in a time capsule of north centric postpartition hindumuslim conflict there is no nuance or logic to this narrative  bjp considers hindu nation as a foregone conclusion based on partition whereas the other side doesnt have any retort other than lets not be a hindu pakistanliberals have lost the ideological battle because theyre living in their own little worlds where they imagine india to be something its not majority of indians dont give a damn about progressive liberal beliefs and are drawn towards charismatic leaders who talk in platitudes what is the alternative to modi? raga? secularism is a noble state policy but it cannot be the only basis for a nation the only ideological challenge hindutva currently faces is nativism from states such as tamil nadubengal assamese opposition to cab is also the same phenomenon  assamese speakers have fallen below 50 in their own state and they dont want to fall any lower than that forget hindu texts  they dont even have to study the constitutionliberals have spent the better part of 70+ years deconstructing and pointing out all the flaws of hinduism but have done little to no attempt at highlighting the good aspects of hinduism to create a positive liberal hindu identity bjp has exploited this hindu identity vacuum by claiming that they understandrespect the good aspects of hinduism   people who wouldve sided with liberals now side with bjp because they respect hinduism  however superficial it may be you should read  this article  https  wwwlivemintcom opinion jyzfxtxjd2igqpqa3mgofn narendramodiandthemysteryofthehindulefthtml  for more details islamophobiayoure playing right into bjps hands by using this term bjp canwill use an uno reverse card and label you as hinduphobic  bottomlineyou cannot defeat hindu identity politics by appealing to secularismconstitution ad nauseam  you have to create a political liberal hindu identity in opposition to their bigoted one and market it to the masses that is the only way i can see hindutva going down in summary1 bjp wants to change india into hindu rashtra2 muslims  christians  dalits and people who take the constitution and secularism seriously will oppose that3 hence the bjp is hiding its intentions now  it has to change peoples perceptions to normalize hindutva even more than it is normalized currently4 so how does it justify its fascism? by creating the conditions necessary for its justification5 muslims protesting in the streets will be portrayed as pakistanis or jihadis who want india to become an islamic state6 students will be seen as supporting pakistan and jihadis  hence antinationals  they want to break india into pieces7 intellectuals are antinationals and urban naxals  maybe even supporting china8 slurs such as these were merely slurs  not to be taken seriously  but now theyll become actual accusations  with perhaps legal  or extralegal  consequences 9 a conflict with pakistan  or a very tangible fear of one  will help these slurs become real accusations10 thus bjp can justify further fascist policies like detention centres  which they deny now   and even unthinkable ones,2019-12-23 06:10:30

Business/Finance,the impact of gst on invoicing  and thus on revenue and profit of organizations operating in india  exploring one of the factors impacting the economy right now,80,d4mq0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d4mq0p/the_impact_of_gst_on_invoicing_and_thus_on/,46,tl drbecause of gst  organizations have to bill the clients in each state that is involved because of gst norms if before gst this required one bill  it now means multiple bills depending on the number of states involved it could go as high 36 bills  29 states + 7 union territories  this means that if pregst x effort was required to make 100 rupees  it now requires nx effort  1 to 36  to make 100 rupees meaning that the work required to make the same amount of money has increased by 100 to 3500 this has impacted the profit of the companies and thus the economy #x200b #x200b #x200b #x200b before i begin  i am not an expert on taxation  i am a business guy working in b2b sales for an indian mnc my 35 year career has been largely postgst  but i have experienced the pregst era as well i constantly have to deal with gst and its numerous requirementsmy objective is to highlight a major roadblock that i and many other business folks have encountered due to gst  and i feel that this aspect is playing a big role in the slowdown and at the same time has been left largely unexplored till now because of the grassroot nature of the problem the people higher up dont encounter this directly and anyone who doesnt encounter this wouldnt understand the gravity of the problem aka reporters  etc again to reiterate  i am not trying to debate the improvements over vat and i am merely here to highlight a side of gst which is hindering my revenue and my profit  thus my business#x200b lets start with some basic concepts first 1  invoicing the act of giving a bill for the products or services utilized by a customer for most people  this is a simple receipt at the end of a meal for instance  or at the checkout counter of a clothing store for the clothes youve purchased  or a bill given by a cleaning service for cleaning their homesbut for an organization  an invoice is the means to collect money from a client anything that is sold to a client will generate an invoice for the products delivered services rendered the invoice will also have the tax details  gst number  billing address  registered address  shipping address  list of items that need to be paid for  applicable tax  cgst  igst  sgst  payment due date  and authorized signatures an invoice is a means to collect cash from the client without a proper invoice  cash cannot be collected this is where the problem starts since not having a proper invoice gives a lot of ground to the client to delay the payment#x200b  2  the process of invoicing   invoicing function in an organization once the product is delivered or the services rendered  or sometimes before they are delivered  invoicing is triggered  meaning that a bill is generated and the money has to be collected from the client this is usually done through an erp like sap or oracle the invoice then reaches the collections department  where the collection manager submits the invoice to the client for verification and payment the collection managers are the front line people tasked with bringing money into the organization they are one of the most important people for running the business because their performance impacts the cash flow of the organizationthey are normally tagged to accounts  aka clients one collection manager could be handling anywhere from one client to thousands  depending on the nature and size of their clientsonce the client verifies the invoice  the money is transferred to the selling organization and it becomes revenue and subsequently profit for themif the client holds the invoice for any reason  then it becomes lost revenue or a bad debt  loss  for the selling organization the longer the client holds this money  the lesser the value that money holds due to the concept of timevalue of money 100 rupees today is considered as more money than 100 rupees one month from now due to the timevalue of money thus a delayed payment impacts the profitability of the organization 3  gst for the services industry gst dictates that the invoicing for services will be done in the state where the services have been delivered i will explain this concept in detail as this is the crux of the problem to start off  i will outline a simple sale and how that sale would translate into the pregst and postgst eraproblem statement assume that tata motors intend to buy 5000 chairs for their offices from pepperfry for 50 lakh rupees tata motors also wants pepperfry to install the chairs in their offices  5 lakh rupees   and then provide 5 years warranty including a checkup every year to determine the life of the chair  and any repairs required  15 lakh rupees  tata motors wants the chairs to be delivered to 50 offices in india  across 20 different states this is a mix of products  chairs   services  installation and maintenance  the total bill is for 70 lakh rupees 5000 chairs  inr 50 lakhsinstallation of chairs in 50 offices across 20 states  inr 5 lakhsmaintenance of chairs for 5 years  inr 15 lakhspepperfry sales executives will take the purchase order from tata motors and put the order into their system the input of the purcahse order will trigger three functionsa  delivery of the products  servicesb  invoicing and payment for the orderc  postsale service  maintenancepregst invoicingbefore gst came into the picture  the above bill would be generated by pepperfry as a single bill centrally ie they would generate a bill for 70 lakhs  with the extra relevant vat and the tax details of the two organizations this would be on one single bill for the entire deal  irrespective of state  city  etc they would just give tata motors one single piece of paper saying that they are owed 70 lakhs with the due date for the paymentmanoj who is pepperfrys collection manager for tata motors will submit this single invoice at the tata motors office where it will be checked by the tata motors procurement and finance teams  and if there is nothing wrong with the invoice  the payment will be cleared off by the due dateagain the point to focus on here is that only one invoice is needed for the delivery of the chairs and services to the entire country manoj has to submit just one invoice  follow up on invoice  and collect the payment on one invoice tata motors teams have to verify one invoice  and process the payment on one invoice only one tax number and billing address is needed on the invoice because it is being done centrallyif there is something wrong with the invoice  manoj has to correct only one invoice and resubmit it to tata motors#x200b postgst invoicinglike i mentioned before  gst dictates that the invoicing be done in the state where the services have been delivered ie separate gst filing for all states explaining further this means that a separate invoice has to be generated for each state that is involved in the transaction if this one state involved  one invoice if two states are involved  then two invoices if five states are involved  then five invoices and in this case since twenty states are involved  twenty invoices#x200b the values of the invoices are split in direct proportion to the usage if 100 rs is the total bill value  in three states  maharashtra  up  kerala with 603010 usage  then the bills will bemaharashtra  60up  30kerala  10so in a sense it is a separate company in each state in terms of gstmoving on to the implication in the tata motors  pepperfry transactionsince the chairs have to be delivered in 20 states  tata motors  pepperfry will have to have a registered office in all twenty states along with a gst number for each state tata motors will have to issue 20 purchase orders in the proportionate value to pepperfry ie 70 lakhs split proportionally into 20 states the sales executive will enter twenty purchase orders into the system then deliveries will be triggered for 20 states and 20 different invoices will be handed over to manoj after generationmanoj will submit 20 invoices to pepperfry  whose procurement department will then verify 20 invoices  give it to finance to verify and then initiate 20 payments then 20 payments will be received by tata motors  with 20 banking transaction ids  and manoj will verify the 20 payments and close the transaction for now this is the ideal scenarioas you might have been able to tell  the effort required by everyone involved in the deal has gone up 20 times this effort required will be the same as before if there is only one state involved on the buying side  ie maharastra selling to maharashtra itll be twice the effort if two states are involved on the buying side  ie maharashtra selling to up  kerala it has a possibility of going upto 36 time the effort required previously for the same amount of money since there are 29 states and 7 union territories yes union territories are treated separately as well#x200b the impact from this is 1  efficiency effort pepperfry is still going to make 70 lakhs on the deal but the effort required will be twenty times that of before because tata motors will give 20 purchase orders on which 20 invoices will be generated the time taken to process these invoices is the same because their value does not impact the time taken to collect the money on them this is because each invoice will be the same template  its just that their  values will be different examplemaharashtrachairs  inr 5 lakhsinstallation  inr 50ksupport  inr 15 lakhskeralachairs  inr 3 lakhsinstallation  inr 30ksupport  inr 90kupchairs  inr 10 lakhsinstallation  inr 1 lakhsupport  inr 3 lakhsthe total money being collected is the same as before but the sales executive  manoj  the procurement guy  the finance guy have to do 20 times the work for it with no other added valuetheir efficiency in this scenario has gone down to 5 but it can arguably go down to 27 if all states and union territories are involved  although this is a rare casealso like i said that this is the ideal scenario it doesnt always go this smoothly some of the challenges encountered area  incorrect proportions of purchase orders   invoices someone made a mistake if 10 needed to be allocated to up  then theyve allocated 11 or 15 the process has to be repeated again after finding the faultb  incorrect gst on po   invoice suppose a particular invoice has the wrong gst  it means that it cant be processed on incorrect tax information  which means that that money cant be collected on that invoice before gst there would be one wrong tax number  now it could be one or two or twenty mistakes happen in the real life this is one of the most common things we face mistakes happened before gst as well  now they just happen in multiples and we really cant expect people to make mistakes because they always will again efficiency goes down as multiple times the effort is required to fix the mistakesc  missing gst it isnt necessary that all companies will have a gst registration in every state so tata motors might not have a registered office in 2 states for example ie they wont have a gst number they will now have to provide a declaration to pepperfry saying that they dont have a gst number for two states  and then pepperfry will be able to give them the invoice the payment of the money is delayed till then getting that declaration in my experience takes a long time because if tata motors says that  they arent able to claim input tax credit in that state thats like leaving money on the table for them  and getting this declaration basically saying that they are willing to lose money on the transaction  requires approvals upto the highest levels because it is a loss to the company manoj now has to follow up on two more time consuming things to get the same amount of money and thus efficiency goes down further 2  cash flow cash is the lifeline of a company a company without cash cannot survive they could be valued at a billion dollars but if they dont have cash to pay their employees  they will shut down kingfisher couldnt pay their employees  interest  vendors because they didnt have cash left  same for jet  again doesnt have cash for payment of salaries  fuel  loan payments  etc bsnl again is struggling to pay for things because they dont have cashthus a healthy cash flow is one of the most important aspects of the business or for the survival of the company if companies were people  cash flow would be the oxygen invoicing is how cash is brought into the companybecause of the decrease in efficiency of the collection managers  a delay is introduced in the collection of the cash so if pregst cash was being collected in 25 days  now it would be taking say 45 days because the collection managers efficiency has gone downand the tiny delays add up incorrect gst  add another 7 days for that cash to be collected  missing gst  add 15 days  etcthis has two outcomesfirstly  because pepperfry had earlier predicted that theyll get the money in 30 days but they are now receiving it in 45 days  that means the 70 lakhs they need at the 30th day for their daily expenses now needs to be found from somewhere else since this 70 days will now be coming after another 2 weeks they will have to dip into the reserves for 15 dayssecondly  the money has lost some value it was 70 lakhs at the end of 30 days but now since time has passed  it has lost some value due to the time value of money it couldve generated interest or it couldve been invested but now this is delayed and hence some value is lost this is a loss to pepperfryto summarize  gst has delayed the payment cycle of the company it now takes longer to collect the same amount of money than it used to before gst was introduced if money takes longer to come in  it takes longer to go out  salaries  interest payments  vendor payments  and other outflows are impacted 3 profit the profit made on a deal varies from company to company and deal to deal let us assume that pepperfry made 10 profit on this deal ie 7 lakhs due to the following factors this profit will get impacteda  the payment cycle is delayed so theyre collecting the profit after a longer duration they will have to collect 63 lakhs before they start making a profit this could be after say theyve collected 13 of the 20 invoices the remaining 7 will give them their profit so basically profit generation is delayed because the cash flow has been delayed this means that the profit made on the deal has lost some value if pregst this was 7 lakhs  now itll be less than 7 lakhs in value due to the time value of money and again because efficiency has gone down  the effort required to generate the same amount of profit has gone up  and thus the profit on the deal has actually gone downb  there are 20 invoices to process not all will always go through many will get stuck and the payment will be delayed or may never come due to the process issues the money that will just linger there and never come to pepperfry will become a bad debt to them if the invoice gets stuck for some reason like incorrect gst  missing gst  incorrect value  the cash wont be collected for that invoice and that amount will get reduced from the profit so because the invoice hasnt gotten processed  the 7 lakhs profit will now be less say 5 lakhs if more than 7 lakhs is not collected on the deal  then pepperfry will actually make a loss on the dealthe biggest culprits of this are psus like hpcl  bpcl  ubi  etc their requirements are so stringent that if there is a single mistake and they hold the invoice this payment could get delayed for years and thus the profit on the deal is impacted they just wont pay till everything on the invoice is correct or they could delay for multiple other reasons many businesses dont sell to psus because of this reason  their profits and cash get stuck in doing business with themthis is different from pregst because earlier if say there was a mistake  there was one invoice to fix now there could be many for the same amount of revenue as before  now chances are you wont make the same amount of profitthus due to the lowered efficiency  longer payment cycle and stuck payments  the profit made has gotten impacted#x200b in conclusion to my ramblings  due to the statespecific nature of gst  the effort required to make the same amount of money as the pregst era has gone up this has impacted the revenue and thus the profit made by companies and these are problems that everyone will face because of how gst is if you want to do business in multiple states  you will have to be ready to face these challengesfeel free to discuss the impact this will have on our economy in my opinion it has had a big impact but i really need someone much more knowledgeable than me to analyze and publish that i feel this deserves a conversation at the very least because this one change has impacted revenue and profit extensively  it has made making money harder and thus is going to have a lasting impact on the economy the worst part is it doesnt look like this system is going to change in the near future#x200b ill probably put a tl dr later,zaplinaki, that was a very enlightening read  thank you for the detailed explanations and examplesso far  id only read handwavy statements like gst is a gamechanger from ivory tower economists  but voices on the ground like yours are the ones that show reality this line in particular surprised metata motors  pepperfry will have to have a registered office in all twenty states along with a gst number for each stateits fcked up that govt expects a service provider to have registered office in every state of the client i know its too long i wanted to do justice to the issue i got tired of writing it lol but ive tried to put down as many details as possible to explain it the anyone who reads it i know the formatting is fucked ill fix that later too this is very good  even with the occasional oversimplification you explained everything clearlyhaving to maintain gst registrations in multiple states  especially for service companies  where the service is usually delivered over the internet  without any goods moving from one state to another  is a huge painone nation one tax my ass yeah  to add to all this1 if you raise an invoice  you have to pay gst the next month without fail whether you can collect the payment or not2 if youre an sme  you have to constantly track whether the seller is filing his sales so that you get input tax on purchases3 make stupid eway bills every time you send material out of the state and make sure they are the same as invoicebureaucrats make these rules on paper and flowcharts without having the experience to earn a single rupee in their life and make us go through with all this bullshit someone is doing more work than our finance minister my ca was telling me that the government has some new regulation in the works that you have to use the sarkari gst software to upload invoices on a daily basis he said it hasnt been put into effect yet but if he is right  that sounds like a disaster for traders very informative post  this is the kind of posts that make reddit india worth browsing  thanks for listing this out imo gst is the single biggest reason behind the current economic slowdown and what you have listed is one of the biggest reasons somehow the taxation and mca rquirements have increased manifold under the modi regime but they are not being called out in the newspapers anywhere the left is busy labelling modi whatnot but they arent willing to go into the details of what is actually wrongthe problem is that the congress left started out by calling modi suitboot ki sarkar now they cant even turn on their blame because in reality modi government is all about more effective taxation as much as possible all of the modi govt initiatives  demo  increased mca compliance  gst  angel tax results in more and more taxation  what they dont get is that in the process of making taxation more effective they have dramatically increased compliance costs for most businessmen and this is negatively impact the economy modi govt is actually more leftists than the left would like to admit and because modi is doing these leftish shenanigans  the left is reduced to calling him names rather than criticise him on policy and specifics i dont understand gst that well  but i used to run a company in the past  pre and post gst era  its still running  but ive moved on whenever we had an outofstate client  we used to raise an invoice with igst  as opposed to cgst sgst split for instate clients wouldnt that simplify the invoicing?like  the head branch of tata motors in mumbai raising a single invoice with igst to the head branch of pepperfry in delhi? as mentioned earlier  i might have got this totally wrong  as i dont completely understand how gst works with large organizations operating in multiple states working with several vendors spread all over the country looks like an excellent saturday read thanks you very my good sir will go thru it later thanks so much  u zaplinaki for making this post and taking the time to explain in all these detailswould you be interested in crossposting in  r indiainvestments ? you just get charged igst if company doesnt have a office gst in the state of receipt of supplywe receive goods from haryana and pay 28 igst on it me what did feku do in 5yrsbhakts demo  gstme neither of them are achievementsbut peanut sized brains that bhakts have dont realize this nobody is coming here because this thread exposes that gst is fucked up feku can do only one nation one insert new nonsense here no tldr  nor read it

Business/Finance,business and boxing two sides of the same coin,6,cqzusw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cqzusw/business_and_boxing_two_sides_of_the_same_coin/,0,by james m dorseya podcast version of this story is available on soundcloud  itunes  spotify  stitcher  tunein  spreaker  pocket casts  tumblr  and patreon  podbean and castboxwhat do a planned us15 billion saudi investment in petroleumrelated indian businesses and a controversial boxing championship have in common?both reflect a world in which power and economics drive policy  politics and business at the expense of fundamental rightsand both underscore an emerging new world order in which might is right  a jungle in which dissenters  minorities and all other others are increasingly cornered and repressedrather than furthering stability by building inclusive  cohesive societies both support trends likely to produce an evermore unstable and insecure world marked by societal strife  mass migration  radicalization and violencea world in which business capitalizes on decisions by a critical mass of world leaders who share autocratic  authoritarian and illiberal principles of governance and often reward each other with lucrative business deals for policies that potentially aggravate rather than reduce conflictno doubt  the planned acquisition by saudi arabias stateowned national oil company aramco of 20 percent of the petroleumrelated businesses of reliance industries  one of indias biggest companies  makes commercial and strategic economic and business senseyet  there is equally little doubt that the announcement of the acquisition will be read by indian prime minister narendra modi  days after he scrapped the autonomous status of the troubled  majority muslim region of kashmir  as a license to pursue his hindu nationalist policies that discriminate against muslims and other minorities and fuel tensions with pakistan  the subcontinents other nuclear powerthe ultimate cost of the fallout of policies and business deals that contribute or give license to exclusion rather than inclusion of all segments of a population and aggravate regional conflict could be far higher than the benefits accrued by the parties to a dealunderscoring the risk of exclusionary policies and unilateral moves  cross border skirmishes between indian and pakistani forces erupted this week along the kashmiri frontier in which at least five people were killedthe timing of the announcement of the aramco reliance deal in a global environment in which various forms of racism and prejudice  including islamophobia  are on the rise  assures indian political and business leaders that they are unlikely to pay an immediate price for policies that sow discord and risk loss of lifelike in the case of saudi and muslim acquiescence in chinas brutal clampdown on turkic muslims in the troubled  northwestern chinese province of xinjiang  the most frontal assault on a faith in recent history  the announcement risks convincing embattled muslim minorities like the uighurs  the kashmiris or myanmars rohingya who are lingering in refugee camps in bangladesh that they are being hung out to dryto be sure  kashmiris can count on the support of pakistan but that is likely to be little more than emotional  verbal and politicalpakistan is unlikely to risk blacklisting by the financial action task force  fatf   an international antimoney laundering and terrorism finance watchdog  at its next scheduled meeting in october by unleashing its antiindian militantsanthony joshuas controversial fight with andy ruiz scheduled for december in saudi arabia  the first boxing championship to be held in the middle east  pales in terms of its geopolitical or societal impact compared to the saudi indian business dealfact is that saudi arabias hosting of the championship has provoked the ire of activists rather than significant population groups the fight is furthermore likely to be seen as evidence and a strengthening of crown prince mohammed bin salmans selective efforts to socially liberalize the once austere kingdomnonetheless  it also reinforces prince mohammeds justified perception that saudi arabia can get away with imprisoning activists who argued in favour of his reforms as well as the lack of transparency on judicial proceedings against the alleged perpetrators of the killing of journalist jamal khashoggi in the saudi consulate in istanbul saudi arabia insists the killing was perpetrated by rogue operativeswhat saudi investment in india and the scheduled boxing championship in the kingdom have in common is that both confirm the norms of a world in which humane authority  a concept developed by prominent chinese international relations scholar yan xuetong  is a rare quantitymr yan employs the concept to argue without referring to president xi jinping  xinjiang  chinas aggressive approach towards the south china sea or its policy towards taiwan and hong kong that china lacks the humane authority to capitalize on us president donald j trumps undermining of us leadershipmr yan defines a state that has humane authority as maintaining strategic credibility and defending the international order by becoming an example through adherence to international norms  rewarding states that live up to those norms and punishing states that violate them garnering humane authority enables a state to win allies and build a stable international ordermr yans analysis is as applicable to india and saudi arabia as it is to china and others that tend towards civilizational policies like the united states  russia  hungary and turkeyit is equally true for men like anthony joshua promoter eddie hearn and business leaders in generalto be sure  aramco is stateowned and subject to government policy nonetheless  as it prepares for what is likely to be the worlds largest initial public offering  even aramco has to take factors beyond pure economic and financial criteria into accountat the end of the day  the consequence of mr yans theory is that leadership  whether geopolitical  economic or business  is defined as much by power and opportunity as it is by degrees of morality and ethicsfailure to embrace some notion of humane authority and reducing leadership and business decisions to exploiting opportunity with disregard for consequences or the environment in which they are taken is likely to ultimately haunt political and business leaders alikesaid mr yan since the leadership of a humane authority is able to rectify those states that disturb the international order  the order based on its leadership can durably be maintainedwhat is true for political leaders is also true for business leaders even if they refuse to acknowledge that their decisions have as much political as economic impactdr james m dorsey is a senior fellow at nanyang technological universitys s rajaratnam school of international studies  an adjunct senior

Business/Finance,what would be a better decision?  serious ,26,abqu80,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/abqu80/what_would_be_a_better_decision_serious/,17,24 year old male  working in a day job from 8 am to 8 pm i come from a bba in finance background but have been working in a jewellery factory i want to learn to programme and investing in the little free time i have programming so that i can switch jobs in two years or at the least freelance  note i have zero knowledge about programming  also  after reading several articles  they mention programming is one of the jobs that is to stay even when robots become prevalent my second option is to start an online business i do not know what the business will be as i really havent thought about itwhat would you do if you were in my position? develop skills or start a side hustle? i make 50k a month and the expenses are growing exponentially ,nosleepnomore, bhai 8am8pm is not a day job  its slaveryaur programme ki jagah program karna seekhnawaise freelancers ki koi aukaat nahi hai  and i can prove that freelancercom pe jaake koi bhi project daalna  india se freelancers toot padenge ill just add some information to help you make your decisionentry level job in infosys pays 25k per month but during their training period there is virtually no expenditure  if you are going to learn programming for job security  and considering robots a threat  no less   without having any knowledge about it  id say try something else you already know programming can be fun but your motivations are not in line with what makes it fun absolutely  try it but dont expect to earn decently in a matter of a couple of yearssimilarly  an online business is too vague if you have some particular thing in mind  we can probably give you a fair idea if well buy it or not if i were in your position  id try programming for a couple of months and look at what i can possibly sell online and if i can find business partners ill tell my experiences here and then ask how i should proceed you can land yourself a high paying programming job provided you have good credentials like hackerearth rank   gsoc rank   github profile i have seen a unemployed nonit bsc chemistry 27 year old guy do it by self learning coding good luck  working in jewellery factory means what? are you a craftsman? learn to communicate clearly what you have experience doing otherwise people without understanding your background might give misleading advice?if you do have some years of training and skill with your hands in making jewellery then its not a bright idea to switch to programming unless you dont like your job  keep improving your skill a skilled person plus a machine will always beat a skilled person alone or a machine alone the problem with robots  like your cell phone   every two years maintaining them and updating software and changing their hardware designs  because what customers want change constantly and hardware improves constantly  is very very expensive so having skilled people operating machines is always going to be the better choicejewellery sector in india is quite big and growing esp exports the amounts people are spending on top quality jewellery has hugely increased one option maybe is to try to move to better companies bigger brand names export oriented companies etc and gain experience  typical indian mentality  get on the it wagon  one true and absolute certain way of survivalso sad the real question is why would it companies hire you as a software dev?there are too many of us already  and for you to catchup its going to be extremely hard even if you somehow become good enough  6lpa will not be what they would be payingnot saying it cant be done  but you should know that to make big money at big n companies  you really have to become great coder which is something i have been struggling with,2019-01-02 20:10:50
Business/Finance,please help me with career advice,19,ahuc0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ahuc0c/please_help_me_with_career_advice/,13,i am a 24 year old male with bba in finance i studied in thailand my family lives in thailand we have a diamond trading business i worked with my dad for a year before finding a job in a jewelry factory i have been working in this factory for little over a year nowi am being paid 55k baht a month the problem is  there isnt much growth in this industry i feel the industry is shrinking i am hoping to get out by this year another problem is  it is very difficult to get a job as a foreigner in thailand what skills can i develop on the side so i can switch industries? i am thinking programming but i have no prior knowledge i do not mind coming back to india for workis mba a good option? what other ways can i make money on the side?i have around 10 lac rupees saved,nosleepnomore, you are making decent money and india doesnt really have the jobs or growth it used todiamond trade globally is dominated by gujjus  why not go up the supply chain and apply for management positions at customer facing companies you dont seem very enthusiastic about your current line of work you definitely need to work for a few more years to get some clarity on the general direction you want to takemba is an expensive decision and should be taken with much more thought and is not a guarantee to reduce or remove your current confusionyou have an advantage of being in a more developed country surrounded by fast growing economies along with india as a backup you already have some professional assets experiences in place use that to discover more and learn and spend your life savings on a degree when you are sure about what you want  so youre talking about career shift and rapid growth with a managerial experience and international exposure  an international mba from top 20 would be a good bet if you want to study in india  isb is one such option do you hold a thai passport? if yes  look into getting into the iims via the foreign student route much easier to get in than through the regular cat tell me which indian dude gets paid 15l per annum like you are  at the age of 24? guys with your qualification in india earn 1 5th of what you earn since youve saved 10l until now  which is a great amount of money for your age  you can do an mba and a pgdm from a top ranked university under nri quota for that amount youll need a good number of years put aside for that  and then youll get jobs that pay above 10lpa in the beginning after that  the skys the limit i think you already earn well enough  and really dont need to come to india which has its own problems of having way too much of competition for a job the thailand govt cares about their country more than india does and i think youll earn really well staying there instead of coming to india lady boi ban ja ,2019-01-20 18:15:34

Business/Finance,broke up 30 what next???,12,al2pdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/al2pdh/broke_up_30_what_next/,12,hi everyone i browse through reddit quite a bit and love the answers and support that comes especially under relationships lifeso here goes my storya little about myself im 30 yr old indian woman working in it and earning well i am the only kid and my mother raised me as a single parent after my dad left usshe has raised me to be independent and has given me freedom unlike other indian familiesi had my share of relations when i was young and i was single for a considerable amount of time in mid 20s and i made good use of it i started traveling and over years have come to love it travel opened doors for me in blogging and photography and my friends say i am decent at both being single also taught me value of friendships and im fortunate to have made some solid bonds over the yearsi met my bf  32 yrs  two years ago and with time we realized we do want to spend our lives together as we started talking about future i realized that my bf is very keen to move to his hometown and take over his family business  agriculture  he mentioned it casually once a yr ago i had no idea he was serious about it   i refused to agree for this as it is hard for me to relocate to a place which has zero opportunities for career i hate the idea of staying at home or being dependent for finances for the reasons above and also that i would be giving up all my friends leaving my mom work  travel everything for one person seemed like a bad dealwe tried to come up with solutions but none of them made of us happy and hence agreed for mutual breakup this breakup has left bitter feelings in me about everything i want to stop feeling negative about my ex  somewhere i feel he could have stayed considering he has been staying in the city for 20+ yrs  and stop feeling sad for myself i am scared that i might end up alone given the age taboo caste etc in india and quite not sure how to deal with all the negativity in my headany suggestions are welcomethanks ablahnaari#x200b #x200b ,ablahnaari, chill dude  no need to worry its better to be alone than with someone with whom youre not comfortable living by yourself has its own advantage   you have time 30 is not that old get back out there when you are ready dont blame yourself  or your ex if you wanted different things in life and had strong convictions about your choices  either one of you would have had to compromise and deal with the resentment that typically follows compromising core beliefs or the relationship would have fallen apart at some point if neither one wants to compromise  if it had to end  its better it ended now and not after you were married and in your late thirties or later give it some time and reevaluate  feelings always clouds reality everyone feels like the universe is conspiring against them after something bad happens time heals most wounds if you let it stay positive i am 33 years old  have never been in a relationship  no marriage proposal seems to work out for myriad reasons  yet i keep faith while also keeping fit  enjoying my life  finding new interests and try to travel as much as i can amidst incredibly heavy pressure from my parents and society last thing one needs is to give in to bullshit societal standards love has no sell by date you mentioned you love to travel  do more of it  its a great distraction plan a trip in the near future travel has healing and transformative powersi wish you all the best  the dude lived in the city for 20+ years and wants to go farm? let him he seems passionate about it  dont hold him backas for you  you are too young to be worried about whats gonna happen to you take it easy and move on  you have no idea whats in store that ablanaari shit was funny though  i am scared that i might end up alone given the age taboo caste etc in india and quite not sure how to deal with all the negativity in my headstop worrying about that crap and work on making yourself a better person pickup some new hobbies hang out with your friends or try making new ones i have to admit that i have not travelled as much as you didbut my only suggestion right now is to pack your bag and leave your home you will get a  better solution as i am pretty sure you will meet up someone who has solutions to all your problems lpt just talk to as many people as possible find new things to do the less you sit and ponder  the better itll be give it time  and then ponder  and let golive life forward  not backwards you took the right longterm decision the blaming  bitterness and sadness for a few months is common convince and coax your mind that you took a good positive longterm decision for the reasons you have yourself mentioned express your thoughts and justifications and plans in some way for me  writing them in detail in a diary worked but if youre not into writing  record an audio or video of yourself discussing it with yourself or if you have a close friend whos a good listener  express it in front of them i dont know the psychology behind why expressing your thoughts to yourself or others actually helps  but it doesas for fear of society  most people dont bother and those who trash talk you can be ignored or even belittled solo life is not bad as you yourself already seem to have explored it quite a bit id suggest getting into any new relationship only for positive reasons  such as love and companionship  and never for negative or shallow reasons  such as fear   reputation   social status  take it from a 24 y o guy  who got cheated multiple times and lost faith in love#x200b smoke a joint  let go off things  and start afresh 30 aint too old you still have a good 45 years before you settle down goodluck and learn to forgive but not forget   30+something  just broke up its very normal to hate your ex even if he she hasnt done anything horrible #x200b be kind to yourself im not a believer in god or spirituality but mindfulness has helped me what are you going through is grief its the same feeling as you would feel if a loved one died you probably already know the 5 stages of grief you are going to go through all of it  not in sequence but in circles give yourself time and be kind to yourself #x200b trust me i went through this  im not out yet  but i am a million times better than what i was immediately after  curious question is the word abla or ablah? i know certain indian demographic ppl like to add h around their ts but cmon why here? i am pretty sure the actual word is ablathankhs,2019-01-30 07:32:58
Business/Finance,is modi making corruption systemic?,419,7c6kh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7c6kh8/is_modi_making_corruption_systemic/,177,with the recent developments in the supreme court  rbi after demonetisation  the media channels brought by bjp  the finance bill which give political parties access to benaami funding he is making the 0001 at the top above law  almost godlike this includes the business tycoons  senior most officials in the government  ministerseditwow getting downvoted without a debate on this keyword modi is trigger for downvoting?,angrybong, modiji understands the iq of indian society very well   sell them dreams and victim complex  rule forever     deleted   removed   removed   removed  is that benaami donation clause honestly in the finance bill that got squeezed through ls? feels like people have kind of moved on from that particular fuckeryedit a word developments in the supreme court heights of desperation nobody has literally any control over the supreme court it is the most opaque arm of our state  always has been stop blaming random shit on modi  your entire argument loses value because you pull shit like this cant believe people just automatically upvote anything anti modi without even reading the bs in the post so it wasnt since the time of indira gandhi?modi is the result of the bullshit spawned by congress over the years now  we have the other side corrupting the system to suit their agendai dont like modi but i hate congress worse  the same sc cji ruled in favour of aap govt in the lg aap turf war and why are you blaming modi  sc judges are appointed by collegium  not our pm yes  there are several videos and reports which are not from the left per se its even from centerists who argue thisalso  you forgot electoral bonds  which is completely annonmyous way of paying a partywhat factions usually do is try to remove blame from modi  and pin in on the preexisting system  absolving the leadership of everything this is a problem because  the leaderships inaction  ratherits tweeks to more streamline the process  is in cahoots with the preexisting system of corruptiontechnically  the present government has not done as much damage as previous ones  but small steps it has taken to legalize corruption  will lead our nation to further ruini am sure thats what our founding fathers would have wanted  my father  let my country be led to ruin   s  generally i think that the more autocratic a government is the more corruption flourishes this is because fewer people have more power  and so can do bigger scams  and because they face less risks of repercussions i read somewhere that corruption in india really kicked off with indira gandhi  precisely because she was the first leader to centralise a lot of power in just her close advisors allies corruption has been a hallmark of indian businesses and politicians way before modi  its like part of its culture and fabric of scoiety that corruption has to exist for things to run at alleven some people told me that without corruption  things cant function at all in india  it just depends on whether its big or small yeah  it was evident long ago hes mastered the art of normalizing corruption they dont even have to hide it thats why you dont hear about any scams at all these days if you dont find a view correct please put counter arguments downvoting only shows your confirmation bias yes its pretty good but im hoping with more years in power im hoping they dont make it a competition between people on the ground like the congress did being a modi supporter i always believed that modi is doing grate thing for our future but from past 6 months show different result and different future modi made black money go away as he promised but in process of making policy of making black money harder  he just made making black money a legal and tax paying due to the policy other people were abel to increase profits margins which eventually lead to high rate of products and an increase in dearness now due to gst and other policies all the product are almost double in price yes  thats the gujarat model more money reaches up  less remains for down guys is systemic appropriate in this case? isnt it supposed to be more of a biological medical term? can some vocabulary nazis help out ? i think modi is doing good job and people know that and appreciates him and thus is voting more and more bjp#acchedinforeva i would happily blame pm modi for this but corruption has been the system in developing world long before he got the top job he is making both corruption and genocides systematic ,2017-11-11 18:33:35

Business/Finance,so you made yourself a little bit of money  huh? how nice,28,9ypjsr,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9ypjsr/so_you_made_yourself_a_little_bit_of_money_huh/,11,# so you made yourself a little bit of money  huh? how nicenbsp all your life  all youve ever wanted  is a little bit of money and congratulations  now you have it does it feel nice? does it feel like a dream come true? of course it doesnt its all just numbers on a screen  staring at you like a pathetic joke but thanks to your thankless job  you made yourself a little bit of money how niceand now  you  in all your halfdecayed intelligence  have decided that you want to invest the little bit of money that youve made? well  step right up to the raging wildfire that is the field of investing weve got a shitshow full of stocks  mutual funds  bonds  real estate  gold and other commodities  all clamouring for your attention  and even more for your money done properly  you can retire into an ungodly amount of wealth and done poorly  you can join the majority of investors setting their cash on fire  day in and day out but dont feel daunted or scared youre on the right path  and thats probably the only time youre going to hear those words in your life just the fact that youre thinking about investing your money puts you at a major advantage  just the fact that youve even made a little bit money is extremely rare look around you  what do you see? people that are so poor that theyre crawling out of their tents on the roadside  people that are such douchebags that theyre buying worthless bling like fur sweaters and gold chains  people that are so childish that they absolutely have to buy the latest iphone with their credit cards  and people that are so dumb that they just cant be bothered to learn about investing just the fact that youre here now  thinking about investing  makes you part of an exclusive clubbefore you get ahead of yourself and feel one cent of happiness for being better off than most  let me tell you something  theres an army of twats waiting to screw you out of the little bit of money that youve made  an army of twats who wants to take away the only thing that matters to your miserable existence anymore these are crooked relationship managers wholl sell you anything to get commissions these are unsuspecting relatives wholl recommend terrible investments just because they dont know any better these are seedy stock brokers wholl push schemes offering incredibly high returns that are too good to be true these are corrupt financial advisors wholl destroy your returns  either because theyre incompetent or unscrupulous  or both youve got an entire armada of twats just waiting to snatch the money right out of your wallet whatre you going to do about that? are you going to put your head down and hand over the cash? are you going to run to your mommy like the little bitch that you are? no  youre going to pull out a knife and stab that little twat right in the heart and heres how to do that  beginning with a set of basic guidelines nbsp ##### savings are sexylets be honest  you were never made of the stuff that gave wet dreams to women well  heres your chance you know what all the girls like these days? its not that ripped chest  or that sleak jawline its a man who saves step aside axe body spray  theres a new sheriff in town if youre spending more than youre earning  youve got bigger problems to worry before anything else  you need to make sure that youre bringing in more money than youre spending so reign in your spending  delay gratification that burger is going to taste pretty much the same without the overpriced slice of cheese and the movie will probably be on netflix in a few monthsnbsp ##### debt is your kryptoniteso you borrowed a little bit of money and are now stuck with the interest payments thats okay  who hasnt done dumb stuff when they were young and full of hormones i know i have this one time i cleaned up an entire jar of mayonnaise thinking it was yogurt set some money aside every month  not just to pay the monthly minimum on your loans  but a little more so you can prepay all your debts some loans take priority over others pay off your credit cards  personal loans and similar highinterest debt first keep in mind that not all loans are straight poison those that help you develop assets like a home loan or increase future income like an education loan or business loan are alright however  investing while carrying a high amount of debt is like playing football with one leg tied behind your back not exactly idealnbsp ##### read like your life depends on itstop reading whatsapp forwards  pick up a book  and then pick another one if you dont develop a habit of reading properly  youre going to get a lot of poop flinged at you in this business but if you can make it through a book every once in a while  get read to fling some poop on the n00bs you dont have to go straight for the finance section begin with any book that sounds interesting to you  and work your way up reading not only helps you understand the world around you  but also develops a better personality and temperament within you most of you have the patience and memory of a goldfish  and generally speaking  goldfishes are not good investorsnbsp ##### gold is oldgold was what housewives in the 70s stockpiled in their cupboard because they had no other option but you  you are the child of the 20th century you actually know how to turn on the wifi you have better options  like mutual funds no matter what your uncle from the third cousin over says  investing in gold is setting your cash on fire all it will do is make you feel good from the inside  while the eternal fireplace fuelled by your cash keeps burning in the background gold and silver are metals that we dig out of the ground as an investment  they just sit there and stare at you just because they shine doesnt mean theyre good investments however  not everyone is convinced of this basic guideline so if youre hell bent on investing in gold  i recommend going into the mountains and throwing yourself off a tall cliff a mediumsized one works toonbsp ##### insurance   investingwhile housewives in the 70s had gold  housewives in the 80s had lic getting life insurance is critical if you have family that depends on your income  but insurance and investing  like pizza and pineapple  never mix well have you ever wondered what the insurance company does after collecting your premium money? well  the company invests your premium money in stocks and bonds  which is also what mutual funds do so let the insurance people insure  and let the investing people invest separation of labour was something that the caveman figured out in 2nd century its time you evolved from being a cavemannbsp ##### real estate is not real investingthe only reason for you to buy property is if youre going to be living in it buying real estate purely as an investment is one of the worst decisions you could ever make real estate is an illiquid market  need to wait to find a buyer or seller   has high transaction costs  stamp duty and other bullshit charges   has a lot of red tape  needs several government approvals  and faces high maintenance costs  occasional cost of paint and plumbing here and there  however  every other tom  dick and harry will tell you that real estate is a great investment why? because real estate is how indians signal wealth to others it is how indians demand respect from the chaar log committee its how we tell people that weve got a big dick  and were not afraid to swing it around you dont have a big dick tuck that little stinker back in your pants youre just embarrassing yourselfnbsp ##### pick your poison properlyidentifying the bad investments is a greater skill than identifying the good investments now that gold and real estate have been vilified as bad investments  lets turn to the places that actually deserve your money  mutual funds for the uninitiated  which includes most of you idiots  a mutual fund collects your money and invests it in the stock market on your behalf a diversified basket of stocks in good quality companies will outperform most other investments over any time period longer than 10 years mutual funds can give you this diversified basket of stocks if you havent been living under a rock for the past few years  youve probably see the advertising campaign  mutual funds sahi hai and if you have been living under a rock  stay there were doing great without younbsp ##### get yourself into a comathe best investors  the ones who win the game in the longterm  always have patience when youre investing in stocks or mutual funds  you need to have a minimum time horizon of more than 5 years any less than that  and out come the fireplaces that are fuelled by your cash mentally  you need to be in a place where the stock market might run off a cliff screaming into the wind tomorrow morning  and youll still continue investing as per your plan because youre thinking about the long term this ensures that your emotions  influenced by the ups and downs of the stock market  dont get in your own way ideally  you want to invest and immediately get yourself into a coma trust me  no one will notice that youre gone youre one person in a world with seven billion people youre really insignificant in the larger scheme of the illuminatinbsp ##### dont watch cnbcall your life  youve only made socially acceptable choices  because you crave validation from the people around you to your repitillian brain  approval from strangers feels better than an orgasm but when it comes to investing  never seek validation of your choices  especially not from the pundits on cnbc televised business news focuses on the shortest of short terms  while you need to keep your eye on the longest of long terms yes  it is important to keep tabs on current events  but there are far better sources of information than the nightly news i recommend reading livemint and reuters for news those two outfits did not pay me to endorse them  but if the pr people over there are reading this  give me a call i accept cash  cheques and paytm fuck it  ill even take bitcoinnbsp ##### keep it simple  shitheadhere is a basic plan on how to use your money when you get paid every month first off  take care of any loans by paying off the hungry bankers who will come demanding their pound of flesh pay off all credit cards  in full and on time now  estimate how much youre going need for your monthly bills  this includes everything from your electric bill to your tab at the local bar deduct that amount and invest the rest of your money when it comes to investing  begin by putting in three months of your monthly expenses in a liquid mutual fund this is your emergency cash stash next up  depending on your time horizon and risk appetite  select a combination of 38 mutual funds there are a few different types of mutual funds  heres a handy rule of thumb to navigate them                                        high time horizon               low time horizon         low risk appetite   largecap equity funds       debt mutual funds     high risk appetite  mid small multicap equity funds debt mutual funds    when youre done  set up sips so that you dont have to do the transfers manually each month every year  take some time off to review this processnbsp this basic plan will require tweaking  depending on the context of your life but having that plan is very important  not just for your financial life but also for the rest of your life in the back of your mind  youve always known that but you never followed through on making a plan  and now your life is just a series of mistakes and regrets is that why you drink so much? the lords of literature require that i write a conclusion to this piece but this is not the end this is the beginning of your investing journey the basic guidelines mentioned here are intended to serve as the starting point for your own research these guidelines are not rocket science  they are not supposed to be complicated a person of average intelligence and awareness can reasonably expect to understand and follow them the question is are you a person of average intelligence and awareness? assuming that enough of you read this  statistics require half of you to admit that youre dumb as a rockalways keep an eye out for the armada of twats that will try to convince you that investing is rocket science  simply so they can charge you high fees or lure you into unprofitable investments done poorly  you can expect a midlife crisis magnified by a bonfire of your cash done properly  you can create the kind of wealth that can benefit you as well as your future generations youve already disappointed your parents dont disappoint your children nownbsp nbsp side note if youre a housewife from the 70s or 80s who objects to your characterization in this article  please write a formal letter of complaint and  shove it up your butt  http  wwwreactiongifscom r bttgif ,DexterMilburn, is this a copypasta or did you actually spend time making up thiswhatever this is heres the tl dr for people who just want the important stuff  without the bells and whistles that i have to attach just to keep your short attention span if youre thinking about investing  take a moment to realize that  strictly in the financial sense  youre doing better than most people in the country be aware of the people who will try to stick you with expensive and bad investments not everyone is out to look for your best interests make sure youre bringing in more money than youre spending without any money left over at the end of the month  youve got bigger fish to fry mmhhmm  tasty fish make sure youve got all your loans and debts under control after your monthly emis  think about setting a little more money aside to prepay loans with higher interest rates  like credit card loans  take priority borrowing money isnt bad  but not having a plan to repay definitely is pick up a book every once in a while start reading any book that picks your curiosity and gradually move towards more topical books on personal finance its good for your health dont invest in gold  or any other commodity youve got better options than that as an investment  gold does nothing but sit there and look at you the exit plan is just hoping that someone will pay higher than what you paid dont mix insurance and investing they are two different services  why would you want to mix them? by separating the two  youre making your financial life simpler and easier  only buy a house if youre going to live in the said house property as an investment is not liquid  aces high transaction costs  requires government approvals  faces high maintenance costs and exists without any transparency identifying bad investments is a greater skill than identifying good investments gold and real estate are bad investments stocks and bonds are good investments mutual funds that invest in stocks and bonds allow you to benefit from them have patience all investing is for the long term the stock market will move up and it will move down some days  it wont move at all none of this should matter to you  because all you care about is the fact that over periods longer than 10 years  the stock market has always created a great amount of wealth dont watch any televised business news channel they give you the news of the day youre not worried about the day you care about the year and the decade for news  read newspapers like livemint and reuters india heres a basic plan when you get paid  make sure you pay all required emis on your outstanding loans with what is left  estimate your expenses for the month this estimate will get better with time take out the money etstimated  and invest the rest begin with having three months of expenses in a liquid fund as an emergency fund after than  pick 38 mutual funds depending on your risk appetite and time horizon refer table above for more information set up sips so that you can force some financial discipline on yourself review the plan annually this basic plan will require tweaking based on the context of your life but having that plan is important investing is not rocket science assuming youre individual of average intelligence and awareness  even you can do it with quite satisfactory results beware of people who will try to convince you that investing is like open heart surgery#x200b  really well written and a fun read thanks for the write up this should be a sticky at  r indiainvestments      mutual fund investments are subject to market risks please read the offer documents carefully before investing i used to enjoy your last week in economy series op keep up the good work any plans to bring it back?

global capitalism are carrying the whole kerala economy  said s irudaya rajan  a demographer at the center for development studies  a local research group there would have been starvation deaths in kerala if there had been no migration the kerala model is good to read about but not practically applicable to any part of the world  including kerala  source nytimes jobs abroad support model state in india  http  wwwnytimescom 2007 09 07 world asia 07migratehtml?_r1pagewanted1  its a pretty good read,pure_haze, damn you op  i was expecting some mallu models   regarding the high crime rate in kerala https  youtube 2eh6owmucniyou may skip to 345 every state has dependence on something i just think that kerala does the right things with their money the risk associated with this source is questionable but the money itself is used in improving hdi and not just bijness related indicatorstheir economy and employment is dependent on three things mainly  tourism  gelf and bangalore maybe their next target itself is to reduce this dependencythe debate is very nuanced with guys like bhagwati and sen arguing the merits of gujarat and kerala models with economics  there are no right answers its just whatever worksnow lets take the other extreme  haryana the economic indicators are off the charts but people still hold onto their outdated beliefs and some parts of the state also has law and order problems and is regarded unsafe for women now is this development and is it sustainable? kerala started out with 47 literacy in 1951  at a time when up had 12 and the indiawide average was 1833 and why was so up being in ganga belt had historically been a rich place of poor people  kerala had better indicator at independence bcoz it had  and has better society  and still today up is a highly divided society for japanese miracle and their industrialization   their homogeneity and social structure played an important foundation part  as a keralite  i find the chest thumping to be a ridiculous showoff at best and the communist revisionism to hijack all the achievements at the worst we will be facing dire issues when the middleeast slows down significantly i personally know so many young men pinning their futures on some small job in the gulf trade unions must be reigned in and the ease of doing business has to improve it wont happen overnight  but that will be the greatest thing the current left government can do and only a left government can doi really wish there was a way for me to return to my hometown as of now  the only way i can sustain my current income if i move back is to go freelance  and that is being optimistic to be fair  a govt can do investment in social welfare without being communist just look at what mamata banerjee is doing in bengal  despite me hating her  she has done some good work in mgnrega  improving the hospitals from their dismayl state  and overall improving rural infrastructure the fiscal deficit and high debt you mentioned was common in communist govt of bengal too when the left left  we had a high debt of over 15 lakh crore  and the current govt is not doing anything either to reign it my main issue with kerala model is that it cant be implemented anywhere else it works for them  good  but we need some other way to lift other states i like breaking big states to smaller  and then working on them likewise  we can produce replicas of goa which have decent social infrastructure as well as good enough ease of doing business to lift people up  one of the less spoken advantages of kerala is that most of its population is either in the cities or live in close proximity to cities i believe factors like high hdi and low imr are because of this but regardless of what brought about its high development  i think the kerala model cannot be adopted by rest of the states if we are looking to emulate  i guess the tamil nadu model of socialism has proven successful tn may not be kerala  but is often #2 or #3 on most counts again  one advantage that tn has had that a state like up does not is that madras has been a prominent administration city since preindependence but i think any benefits from that are minimal at the moment  radicalization is a problem in islam itself i dont think the rates of radicalization are more in kerala in comparison to an equivalent muslim population of that number elsewhere  do you have a source for this? while op is raising legitimate points about keralas economy  you seem to be missing the whole point about kerala model kerala model is that it has achieved very high material quality of life human development indicators  despite being a low income statethe reason it is called a model is because it is unique pretty much everywhere else in the world economic growth and quality of life or human development go handinhand but strangely kerala managed to improve material quality of life with little economic growthby arguing that keralas economic growth track record may be considered abysmal  though a fair point  you are only reinforcing the concept of kerala modelnobody calls kerala an economic miracle  everybody knows it is not is it a replicatable model? maybe not is it the key to solving the problems across the country? definitely doesnt seem like it has historic circumstances contributed? perhaps but historic and geographic reasons also limits its economic potential too so that is argument that cuts both ways now  i would say it is facetious to argue that the outcomes have solely been due to the gulf boom  because the impact of the gulf boom on kerala really began only in the late 80s kerala declared hundred percent literacy in the early 90s  which would not have been possible without strong government policies over the years also some of the places with most gulf nris  such as malappuram  are actually some of the most backward areas in kerala  and to give credit to the travancore royal family is laughable  because if that were the case then many regions in southern tamil nadu today was part of the  erstwhile travancore kingdom while  parts of the travancore kingdom that is in kerala have done extremely well  parts that are with tamil nadu have yet to catch up also travancore kingdom is probably covered less than 30 of modern kerala it is very clear that the most significant government policy that laid the foundation for this transformation was the massive wealth redistribution program launched by the first kerala government  which was a communist government so  what has the kerla model achieved? fewer children are dying  fewer mothers are dying  there are fewer illiterate people more and more people are getting skilled  hence are able to find higher paying jobs  albeit  elsewhere i would argue that we are yet to yield dividends of kerala model so  yes it is a model is it the best model? it is hard to say has it its own advantages? oh yes definitely  the riot cases are high because almost everything is registered and reported  https  enwikipediaorg wiki nokku_koolione of the most ridiculous things i have ever heard of upvotesgrabs popcornlet the games begin i think best things that happened to kerala were  progressive travancore state  early communist government and lots of christian missionarieschristian missionaries and progressive travancore state meant that the state had a robust education system providing for a progressive and good labor base for development communist govt took land from absentee landlords and redistributed land among landless laborers also  brought social parity by working against caste system social parity is very much a prerequisite for economic growth kerala achieved is much earlier than othersstate couldnt take full advantage of its lead  but remittances or not  it did have a headstart on other states in early independence days  2 unemployment rate despite the dependence on remittances and foreign jobs  the states unemployment rate is 125 against the allindia level of 5  making it the third highest in the country after sikkim and tripuratrue but like  i_hate_circlejerk and many others have mentioned  there is an aversion to blue collar work in kerala its not because of the unavailability of jobs its not the best feature to have  but this happens in most emancipated societies this is more of an issue of how daily wage work is seen from a societal perspective   merits  sustainability of the kerala modelseems to more kerala thrashing than anything else dont see too many merits mentioned   kerala has a lot of things going for it  and id rather be here than anywhere else in india but it has its own challenges as well  just like any other statewhat malayalis should do is to not gloat too much about how they are better that this or that state in india  but really look at where they are falling shortthe reality is that if the gulf money dries up  kerala is fucked either produce capital and expertise in the state  or leave your beautiful homeland to work in possibly unfriendly places for those who have it  why so much unemployment in kerala?   deleted   kerala started out with 47 literacy in 1951  at a time when up had 12 and the indiawide average was 1833and that 47 started off from 0  thanks to keralas proclivity to open up and mix with other cultures the various social reformation movements  and influx of christian missionaries among many other factors contributed to this who claimed it was all postindependence govts? the ems govt though  made giant strides in postindependence kerala through its  education bill  https  enwikipediaorg wiki kerala_education_act_1958_ act_6_of_1959    its not _all_ post independence  but a _lot_ _was_ post independence  unemployment rate despite the dependence on remittances and foreign jobs  the states unemployment rate is 125 against the allindia level of 5  making it the third highest in the country after sikkim and tripuratrue but like  i_hate_circlejerk and many others have mentioned  there is an aversion to blue collar work in kerala its not because of the unavailability of jobs its not the best feature to have  but this happens in most emancipated societies this is more of an issue of how daily wage work is seen from a societal perspective   political violenceviolence is never a good thing  but political violence is slightly different political awareness among a population is generally considered to be a prime metric in considering the collective intelligence and societal emancipation of a region in kerala  political awareness is super high this is often misused by parties  but political killings like what the bjp  rss  have been spreading  are super low the only political killings that do happen in kerala are always rss  cpi  m   in north kerala while these are highly condemnable  they are exceedingly rareand also  crime metrics are reported and recorded much more stringently in kerala  thanks to a well functioning executive you might remember a report about how scandinavia had reported extreme high cases of sexual assault similar situation  though high influx of migrants is also a problem there  hotbed for isis recruitementthis seems to be the most ridiculous of them all almost right out of the rss playbook quoting the exact same article youve quoted  indias muslim population  the third largest in the world  has so far contributed negligible numbers to isis  fewer than 90 people  according to most estimates more have gone from britain  even from the maldives  than india  sure  wahhabism is a growing threat in kerala  and more and more muslims seem to be drawn to it but the absolute numbers here are abysmally small and cant really be considered a metric at all and finally  the extreme dependence on remittancesremittances undeniably drive a bulk of keralas economy youve provided good numbers  sure what is your point though? agriculture and brain drain might be flipsides to it  but comparing to other states that _do_ depend on agriculture  isnt it better that people are employed abroad and are bringing money into the economy rather than flail about in abject poverty? it is funding a flourishing society  and malayalis have built up vast business empires abroad and are employing thousands of indiansaccording to this logic  all of the it engineers flocking to bangalore  are bad for the nation  because they should be doing agriculture  and not depend on the us for offshore development projectsps kerala has a bunch of issues treatment and safety of women  fewer opportunities for employment etc are clear and present problems but op seems to be more interested in painting a comprehensively poor picture of the state  misrepresenting facts source  22 years in kerala wants to discuss meritspoints out only demeritsyeah  op is clearly unbiased thanks op as a keralite  i felt that the whole keralaisbest circlejerk on randia was getting out of hand this was

seeing the state of top mba colleges  id say top 20 are best other than that  its useless doing an mba many of my friends did engineering then immediately mba and now earning 678 lakhs per annum after spending 6 lakhs for two years  doesnt make any fucking sense roi  and brand name play a major role when it comes to do an mba i agree with op to the point that this case of high competition  rat race and missed opportunities exists even among top 10 colleges of the country thus  if you are planning to do an mba  go ahead only if it suits your profile or your expected career progression  and not just because everyone is doing it  thanks for posting this  people need to know the kind of fraud mba education is in many colleges my friend was the secretary of the owner of some private institutions who owned some b and c grade schools and colleges they decided to start an mba college and built one fancy looking building within another campus of their college they were not affiliated with anyone and offered a postgraduate diploma in somethingsomethingmba  note that they are not affiliated to anyone and this diploma is just a worthless piece of paper they were having a tough time attracting candidates and one day the ceo asked my friend  her secretary to go and find out what the issue was he went there during the admission seasons and also joined in with the supporting staff he managed to convince 12 students to join the institute the ceo immediately made him the admission officer for the institute the next year  the second batch under him got 32 admissionsthe fees in the first year was 8 lakhs and the second year had been hiked to 10 lakhs  after the 2nd year  my friend requested a transfer to an engineering college so that he wouldnt feel guilty about how he was literally cheating people to do an mba that had no value at all  where did you do your mba from  op? is christ university bangalore any good ? how would you rate the indian school of business? cat 18 aspirant here not serious as per now   currently studying in an average engineering college 80 chances that i will be placed in a mass recruiting company ms from abroad or mba from india  as a fresher? dont downvote  ik both of them are completely different but my aim is to get a good package and a better life  the reason abroad  i belong from a middle class family but parents are ready to spend around 40lakhs for education hows fore and symbiosis? which was your mba institution?   deleted  hows scmhrd? asking for my sister whos planning to do mba this year  just a clarification  what constitutes top 25 though?rankings in india are very different in different systems id say the old iims come first  then mdi  xlri  fms  iift  spjimr some iits are also in the top 25 any particular list to follow?

best bit for you is your son is in a perfect age to hit a jackpot as i said  i was 16 when we immigrated best thing is that indian high school system is rigorous while in canada  high school is a breeze  comparatively   while universities are a significant jump in difficulty at your sons age  he will get a significant advantage as he would already know much of the content in maths and science that is taught here in grade 11 and 12 but he has to grab the opportunity as well if i were in india  the best i would have thought of was ld college of engineering  or ms university of baroda  yet i was able to do engineering from university of toronto  which is better than any iit keep in mind that he has to grab the opportunity i had plenty of indian friends  but almost none of them took the opportunity i had done 11th standard in india  and had to do 11th and 12th again here if your son studied in gujarati medium  he might have to work hard initially i was in english medium if he studies all the way until 12th in india  a downside is that now canadian universities dont know how he measures up against local applicants  and now he might be competing against international applicants so  better if he is part of canadian high school system before 12th  he will likely have to give ielts  academic module  toefl regardless  btw  is indian food available in stjohn nb???every small town in canada has it but no guarantees that youll like the taste often  indian restaurants in remote towns cater to taste buds of white people than indians a tradeoff of not living in toronto  i guess are there any other provisions to get the p r earlier??try express entry check  crs tool  http  wwwcicgcca english immigrate skilled crstoolasp  and see how much you score as of oct 2018  people with score of 442 were granted pr 12 my elder son is of 22 years how can i sponsor him other than student visa?please dont go for student visa you have the right thinking people come here with admission in any random college in canada  college  diploma  university  degree if he has done bachelors  and working  best bet is for him to get 23 years of experience and apply through express entry  try crs tool for him as well  i know someone who immigrated recently at age of 25 and is doing pretty good pr from day 1 and none of the struggles that people who come on student visa go throughi dont think you can sponsor him he has to apply by himself as he is already 21 he may get additional points if you are a pr citizen  but not sure youll have to confirm with the crs link above my ultimate goal is to settle in canada with family in pleasant weather province please suggest place or another possible sourcespleasant weather? vancouver but it also rains a lot in vancouver in summer still better than having snow in other parts of canada though vancouver is crazy expensive to live in though  because of chinese black money in real estate second  id put toronto less snow than other parts of canada  and even cities like ottawa  montreal toronto is expensive as well  but toronto suburbs should work out wellconcluding thoughts it is a big change to move at age of 50 as you said  you are resetting your social  family life  and business at this point  you are moving for the sake of your son than yourself if it was just you and kaki  i wouldnt recommend immigrating please consider the fact that you are also subjecting your wife to a completely new environment  with no relatives around there are a few gujaratis in nb now  moncton  fredericton etc  but most are international students  so not sure how youd relate call me emotional  but it still haunts me that my future generations wont be able to communicate with me in gujarati if i remain in canada the rest of my life not that they wont know how to  but they wont be comfortable in 23 generations  the language will be wiped out from your family also  same thing about good values that might be unique to india i am still not at peace with this  and am planning on returning back in a couple of yearspm me if youd like to discuss more we can chat over whatsapp if youd like you make the decision  but i can make you aware of all the realities based on the experience iv gathered here in more than a decade  and that might help you make the decision your salary is quite low man  even for nb since you are going with a teenage son  who will enter college  your wife will have to work otherwise you wont be happy at all incredibly paltry salary  and there are very few opportunities available in st johns for getting higher salary than this that place has very high unemployment rate sort this aspect out  rest everything will fall in place  id advice you to post this in r canada and r abcd as well you might get better answers there having traveled to both countries  100000 times yes 50 is 25 in canada you are quite the young man  sir good luck r iwantout what are you waiting for? as long as you have done homework on validating the pr in 6 months claim  what do you have to lose?  stay there for 5 to 7 years  become a citizen  get your son a decent shot at life in canada and if you dont like it go back you have worked till 50 and obviously ahmedabad has not given you what you are looking for otherwise  you would not be thinking about leaving at this stage of life as someone who left india at the age of 17  trust me when i say you will be giving your son the biggest gift any parent can give a child a gift of choice i say go ahead and dont look back negotiate everything but dont look back  bhaiyya kitni baar bahar gaye ho? culture shock na ho jaye kahi sare aam chumma chaati karte logo ko dekh karand the society there is different so be prepared that indian way of thinking needs to be changed weather will be extremely cold compared to gujarat  its not worth it you shall suffer from the lack of food  a familiar natural environment  social life et cetera really not a good decision,2018-11-11 22:23:29

i did llb around 10 yrs back  not practicing i had a classmate 60+  only reason he did was because he wanted to learn more very nice person  he once fought with traffic police as his car was towed from legal parking area traffic constable brought back his car  and said sorry to him llb 3 years course is for those holding graduation 5 years for 12 pass attending classes is compulsory if you are in good college and no one cares in many others  i had 4 in my second year so attending evening or full time should consider the college he gets admitted toowhile studying and reading the cases is very interesting  practicing would mean spending many years with zero to very low income many of my friend still makes less than 10k a month this is where top law school matters if you are graduate of such place then getting into good law firms get easyi believe everyone should do llb no matter what you do it helps to know the law du law admits people only upto 30 years of agenot sure about the iit it doesnt have a great rep though  a law school needs years of establishment to have good faculties most of what ive heard about iit law course was the teaching is terrible  if he has ample financial reserves in the form of alternative income rent ancestral property  it can be a very good option only the very few in india can truly dedicate themselves to litigation without running after money on the other hand if you think of making money from law after entering it at age 36  you are likely to be disappointedeasy and quick money in law is only in transactional law  ie drafting up agreements affidavits documents and registering them etc  and in consultancy advisory  eg being on a businessmans negotiating team while he they negotiate an agreement merger tieup with a potential partner  transactional practice can be independent selfemployed as well  infact most lowlevel lowskilled independent lawyers make money through drafting agreements of leave and license  rather than appearing before a court you can make 3035 k per month from drafting rent agreements and affidavits  you can barely hope to make 15 k per month from fighting cases in court even the better known law firms in mumbai do not offer their freshers 3035 k pm as starting salaryan area in litigation is indeed profitable but it is cornered by the niche profession of solicitor firms   few solicitor firms will agree to recruit someone at 36 years of age the best thing is someone who owns huge profitable land rent independently practising law in the courts  ie actually pleading before a court thats how the profession used to be in preindependence india why should there be any age limit to study ageism is part of casteism i guess  there is no age limit for learningfor preparation of clat  u may suggest this free clat mock test site  https  wwwcybermocktestcom clat   if he already has masters degree why doesnt he just take a net exam and teach? law undergrad student from nlu patiala  hereim sure your friend has a graduation degree  so i will not suggest going for clat  since it is particularly for a 5 year course which is integrated course pursued by students after their 12th the variants of these courses depending upon the nlu are ba llb hon   bsc llb  bba llb etc5 years for a course is too much  when he can successfully pursue a 3years llb degree i will suggest checking out bvp pune  bhu  etcits a much better utilisations of his time and resources too  given that a fiveyear course is very intensive with compulsory attendance and 2 lacs in fees in a year  approx  if you consider the nlus and other top collegesi would recommend a 3year course from a reputed state university over 5 year course through clat never too late for education and starting afresh aiming for a goalhed just need to keep the eligibility criterias in check may i know which city your friend is based out of?  in my time at law school  i have seen 4050 somethings sitting with us 20 year old kids good thing about law is  it doesnt have age limits and or any retirement age some state bar councils do have 45 year age limit  i am not sure if it was challenged in court  but thats a nonissue it can be a task to learn nuances and practicalities of legal practice when youre 30 plus but its not a challenge big enough to be a roadblock for him to take up lawbest of luck to your friend  i study in a clat affiliated institute we have never had anyone his age study here thats because clat institutions dont have a 3 year llb course we only have a 5 year ba llb course or a bba llb course so hell have to shift to another city for 5 years and go to class everyday with 1718 year olds ask him not to give clat and research about colleges which give the llb degree alone for that  he should already have a graduate degree like ba  bsc or bba many factors need to consideredhe will feel the age gap a lot  especially if in a 5 year program but also in some 3 year programs since many students join straight after college the exception to this is probably du and glc  mumbai the reason for that is attendance is not an issue and du still has evening batches these attract older candidates who are working during the day and also upsc aspirants who have law as a back up your friend will find it easier to gel with the crowd at such places your friend might be able to continue working while studying even more so if its a teaching job and its part time those can be kind of chill and he is already working there  so cancerbased discrimination may be low regarding placements hr recruiters will want cheap workers with no baggage hence  ageism crops up law schools  all colleges for that matter  are factories and unfortunately  your friend will be an outlier he is highly experienced in diverse fields this is bad and good recruiters wont know what to do with him or he will get a offer appropriate for a 21 year old it can be good if he finds a job that values his experience in btech  mba etc but that takes a lot of hustling to find yet he will have to explain 4 years of unemployment truth is  his classmates will be safer bets and his getting recruited through the formal placement process will be tough litigation stream is always an option its slow work in the beginning but hed be self employed or in a small firmhim being a cancersurvivor  if i were in his shoes  id opt for a college with chill attendance  continue with the teaching write the llb exams build up contingencies for a cancer relapse  good insurance  access to healthcare  savings  then carry on with life with the above priority  job with health benefits  low stress  and try to be happy tldr technically  age is no barrier still  itll be tough he should consider parttime and retain his day job it is doable cancer changes everything relapse is a risk that he will have to mitigate always  deleted ,2018-03-24 03:16:03

Business/Finance,suddenly  one nation  one policy sentiment is overtaking other models interview with yv reddy  ias  former rbi governor and 14th finance commission chairman,6,azoh6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/azoh6g/suddenly_one_nation_one_policy_sentiment_is/,3,you have said in your book that there is a feeling in some quarters that cooperative federalism is being replaced with coercive federalism what is the basis for this comment?some developments have taken place after the 14th finance commissions  fc  recommendations cesses and surcharge have increased significantly  even after gst the states felt that they were being shortchanged by the way the centrally sponsored schemes  css  were restructured  increasing the share that the state government has to put in and then the way the gst is being administered the general debate earlier was about the bihar model competing with the gujarat model and different states models of development competing with each othernow  suddenly the one nation  one policy sentiment is overtaking the other models and the planning commission  which was a forum for states  is also not there nowdue to this institutional vacuum  ministries are directly dealing with css so  the spirit of discussion and dialogue is being replaced by diktats by various ministries some say that there is no dialogue  which is untypical of cooperative federalismyouve said that states are now forced to share more from their own resources in css after your own 14th fc recommendations  the impression was that the centre was devolving more to the states as it went up from 32 to 42as my coauthor gr reddy will explain  the comparison is not between 32 and 42  what was 39 became 42  because of the way the computations differed this increase was more than offset by the other actions on cesses and surcharges and css so there has been virtually no advantage for the statesgr reddy the 14th fc considered the entire revenue account unlike the previous fcs  it considered even the plan revenue account as a result  some of the plan transfers were subsumed under tax devolutionthe difference between 14th fc and others is that the former did away with sector specific grants that amount to 45 of the total devolution if you take these two together  the actual devolution would have been 39 earlier and that became 42 even this 3 increase is not very visible because it has been more than neutralised by the centre the reality is that it has increased the matching contribution of the states in css and done away with 6000 model schools started in 2011  half way through  in 201516  it took a decision to terminate the entire scheme of model schoolsthe entire burden of running schools and meeting expenditure  both capital and operational expenditure  has now fallen on the statesthey then restructured 66 css into 22 umbrella schemes so there is no change in the number of css schemes all components have remained the samewhy didnt states raise the issue?we have done so before the 15th fc and communicated to the centre that what they had done was not correctimmediately after the 14th fc recommendations were accepted  the hon prime minister wrote to us saying now that the states are flush with funds  we wrote back saying there is absolutely no increase in the flow of funds to the states  but only a change in the composition of transfers in favour of untied transfers now what has happened is there has been a qualitative change in the transfers to states  we are getting more money through untied transfersthe total transfers as a percentage of gross revenues to the states from the centre has remained at the same level  49arent untied transfers desirable? it frees states to use funds for whatever purpose they deem fitwhatever additional money to have come through untied transfers is now tied up towards meeting the additional commitmentin the revised pattern of css  you have to put in more moneyyou have made a commitment  you cant uncommit but they have changed the pattern whatever untied funds you have got  you put in those schemesfor example  in 2014  telanganas contribution to the css was around 2 000 crore in 201516  because of the change in funding patterns  it has gone up to 3 500 crore so there is additional commitment on the part of the statesthere is further commitment for states  because of termination of some css  the model schools scheme is an example another is brgf  backward regions grant fund  for telangana state  9 of the then 10 districts were under the brgf they substantially reduced allocations under women and child welfare alsothere is a view that there are just too many css  money is not efficiently usedthe other concern with css is that the money is too thinly spread across schemes for example  if you take education or health  states are spending close to 80 the centre is supplementing the states up to only 20  which does not make much difference that too comes with conditionalities  submission of uses  visits of central teams  delays in release of funds as a result of these procedures  we are unable to fully utilise the centres allocations i dont think any state has used the funds from centre entirelyso the solution is to offer funds and allow states a free hand?the commission under dr reddy recommended the same  that the number of css should be restricted to some nationally identified prioritiesdr yv reddy basic issue is that finance commission is one mechanism which essentially is meant for sharing of taxes and that is based on a formula 8090 of transfers to states has always been on tax devolution in tax devolution  there are no conditions  how much weight you give for population  which census population and other consideration namely as fiscal capacity the only question there is what weight you give if you give weight equally for efficiency and equity  they cancel out  in some senseyou mentioned institutional vacuum do you think niti aayog has not been able to step up to the plate?there were some deficiencies in the way the planning commission functioned there was an impression given to the states that they had to go to the commission as a supplicant but not for discussion that was its weakness which had to be corrected in the correction process  that bad habit was got rid of but there was no new system there is no forum now each ministry has become an authority unto itself and is able to dictate terms to the statesis it deliberate that the aayog does not have power or did it evolve thus?that is a question mark whether it was by design or by default  the result is that the individual ministries are indicating to the states  which means there is no coherent and comprehensive view of the states in the processthere is a view that some of the terms of reference of the 15th fc may not stand the test of constitutional validity whats your view?there are 34 issues it is true that it generated unprecedented reaction never before for an fc have a number of cms got together and protested also  some scholars questioned the constitutional validity of some terms of reference  for example  whether there is need for revenue deficitthe constitution provides for it and each fc needs to decide on this third  the 15th fc has been asked to review the 14th fc it is a continuing process above all  the commission has been asked to make recommendations keeping in view some performance indicators and that states should conform to certain policy parameters  which reflected the existing policy of the centrethe way the fc is structured  it is not supposed to be an instrument of the central governments priorities of the day so it has been questioned on several groundsmost of the considerations mentioned in the tor are not necessarily binding on the fc the commission can choose to or choose not to take these into account but it needs courage and vision for the commission to do so  we are hoping that will be therewhats your view on the controversy over the base date of population census in the 15th fc?the whole question is whether it is a correct thing or not it is difficult to defend outdated population as the basis because the fc is supposed to take into account the needs of the state for the period how can 1971 population determine the needs of the state in 2021? it was undertaken on the grounds that states should not be penalised but what about states that have taken action on family planning after 1971? they dont get anything it should be a continuing incentive  right?this time  they prescribed 2011 population that is also not valid the fc recommendations are from 2020 so you should have estimated population of the states for the period 20202025 ideally  there should be no stipulation of a date for population and should be left to the fc but if at all  one should have the population relevant for the periodisnt gst a good example of cooperative fiscal federalism?it is an extraordinary institution and is commendable it did not come into existence overnight it started as an informal committee in the finance ministry and has evolved in the implementation  there has been dissatisfaction expressed the fact that the centre has a veto increases its influence but that is part of the game concerns may be there in the way it is working but as an institutional set up  it is extraordinarily good it is a good example of collaboration and cooperation in an institution between the union and the statescan this be replicated in other areas?exactly this is on the revenue side on the expenditure side  fiscal transfers outside the fc  it can be brought under some interstate council that was the recommendation of the 14th fcthe gst council may not be replicated but is a good approach to build on on the expenditure side  it is a different type of collaboration  compared to the revenue sideis that a recommendation that the 15th fc can give?yes the transfers to the states from the centre can take fc and nonfc routes the 14th fc gave recommendations on how to structure the nonfc transfers its only in the ambit of advicethere are three approaches virtually abolish the commission by making a constitutional amendment and say this will be the percentage  the second is to have a continuous fc  a gst council type of mechanism but the fc gets subsumed in this  the third is to have the fc and a design of new institutional arrangements which will be more technical  more political and more consensusbased  as recommended by the 14th fcall this is provoked partly because of the gst council which has been positive and partly because of the institutional vacuum  both these are pushing us to find new institutional mechanismspleasantly surprised at the functioning of the gst council it comprises people with varying vote bank compulsionsthe consensus has been the result of number of years of effort consultative process has been going on for the last 1015 years states also are convinced that it is a winwin situation  for the sake of tax harmonisation across the country  they felt it was better and there was also the feeling that gst is a better form of tax  leading to better compliance it builds up a value chain initially  there was some apprehension on part of manufacturing states that they may lose out this being a destination tax so we have put in place a 2 year statutory mechanism that they will be compensated for a period of 5 years the states have yielded lot more space than the centre for states  vat constituted about 60 of their old tax revenue they have conceded 50 of their fiscal space to the centre  whereas the space conceded by the centre is only 30 they still get customs duty  income tax etc in the working  there is still a trust deficit because the voting pattern is fully loaded in favour of the centre  which has almost a veto powerthen  the way the gst is administered is also raising apprehensions in the minds of the people that they are not being treated fairly by the centre like delays in apportionment of igst  delays in payment of compensation cess  collecting more compensation cess than required best thing to do is to reduce compensation cess correspondingly that they are not doing so there is surplus compensation cess lying with the centre to be distributed after 5 years it is for the centre to set the record straight and remove this trust deficiton the special category status for andhra pradesh  what was the stand that you took in the 14th fc?special category status is not under the jurisdiction of any fc in my book  i have explained the centres version of the relationship between 14th fc recommendation and the special categoryif you want the simple truth  14th fc did not make any recommendation on inclusion or exclusion of special category the issue of according special category status and assurance by the pm was given months before the 14th fc could give recommendationsbut the government has its own explanation as to why it interprets the recommendations of 14th fc with regard to special category status i have given that in the book it is for the reader to decide why and how these are relatedcess is becoming a monster in the administrative system with gst we assumed that cess wont any longer be a part of the system but with kerala  we have a disaster cess isnt the purpose of a reform lost with such acts?there is a calamity fund and the centre is expected to come to the assistance of states when such things happen and there is always a burden sharing  you cant anticipate this now the recourse to cess for such things is unusualisnt this a step away from cooperative fiscal federalism? the council is telling one state that funds needed for rebuilding after a disaster are to be generated from within that statethat is why some of them are dissenting calling it coercive federalism these are innovations that some states are uncomfortable withyou have kerala at the upper end of the social development scale and uttarakhand at the lower end  tn  gujarat and maharashtra at the higher end of the economic development index with odisha and bihar at the other how is it possible for any central body  including the fc to reconcile these differences?that is exactly the issue with regard to any federation in any federation there are competing considerations you have to build trust amongst yourselves so therefore there is no fixed formula thats how you operate the systemwhat is needed is for the centre to be able to bring together the states and treat these inequalities or calamities as a national problem in which both union and states participate problem now is that whenever a state opposes the centre it is accused of being antinational being antiunion is not antinationalthere are 3 levels of debate  state interest  union interest  national interest to build a national consensus  the union and states must be together if the states get the feeling that the union has abrogated to itself the sole authority of national interest  the states resent it that is the essence of the matterhow much is this because of a strong leader at the top?you should go back to constituent assembly debates dr ambedkar when introducing the draft constitution  discusses the merits and demerits of parliamentary and presidential form of government and says why parliamentary system is important for india he says that india is essentially undemocratic and therefore emphasises on continuous accountability he says continuous accountability is more important than stability that was the deliberate choice on this type of issuein 14th fc  you recommended forest cover as a determinant in the five years that have lapsed  have you studied how that recommendation has helped indias environment cause?no but its an interesting area where we have to see the impact of the recommendation but the logic is simple  forest cover the state govt is contributing to environment at a cost to itself it cannot use the resource but has to maintain it so you have to provide for it the basic principle is externalities the state is contributing at its own cost  it does not gain anything it incurs cost to maintain the forest the hindu  https  wwwthehinducom business economy yvreddyinterview

mint and that is where she begins on this journey as part of the book she has interviewed over 52 subjects including balakrishna  ramdevs deputy and owner of 94 of shares of patanjali ayurveda ltd so here we go baba ramdev  ram kisan yadav  was born in said alipur in a poor farming family a sickly child he rather became very obese and was a victim to his fathers frequent violent outbursts  somewhere in his early 20s  he finds a band of arya samaj workers and is immediately drawn to them he joined khanpur gurukul where he learnt sanskrit grammar  tended cows  collected alms and met his future deputytobe acharya balakrishna balakrishna is quite into ayurveda and is from haridwar where he befriends acharya karamveer  a stoic  soft spoken arya samaj member who had three post graduate degrees in yoga  indian philosophy and vedas karamveer soon takes balakrishna under his wing and soon ramdev joins them after a controversy ramdev learns yoga from karamveer to propagate yoga to masses they soon take over ownership from shankar dev  a patron of kripalu bagh ashram at haridwar shankar dev wants and only trusts karamveer but since he is arya samaj member he is not just ready to take sanyas sensing an opportunity  ramdev steps in taking sanyas means two things   1  he cant keep any formal relations with his family 2  he cannot maintain any material wealth i am bringing this up of course because this is very important balakrishna meanwhile sets up divya pharmacy using the license of a silent partner  swami yogananda balakrishna himself from nepal has legal cases against him  still in courst  for forging his high school and other documents to attain a passport in early 2000s  aastha and sanskar become household name the tv guys select ramdev over karamveer because  saffron robes means authenticity an interesting story here is that after aastha turned ramdev down  our diligent baba went to sanskar paying rs 1 lakh for a twenty minute slot this is also where i learnt that channels like sanskar and aastha dont earn from advertising but godmen paying them for tv slots to demonstrate their abilities we all now know the story ramdev becomes a household name  not only to nauli kriya or churning of the stomach but also his personality  selfdepreciating humor and showmanship  soon ramdev has friends at high places mulayam singh  nd tiwari from congress  sudarshan agarwal  ex up governor so when they are charged with sales tax fraud  sudarshan agarwal mounts immense pressure on sales tax deputy commissioner to drop the case and retire ramdev soon brings his extended family who takes over the business his younger brother ram bharat is soon in charge of the finances this causes rift between karamveer and ramdev afterall ramdev shouldnt have familial relations so one day  karamveer just walks out  swami yogananda  whose license enabled the setting up of divya pharmacy  has a falling out with them soon he is mysteriously knifed to death the neighbors are cagey and the case goes unsolved  enter rajeev dixit  a swadeshi and founder of azadi bachao andolan ramdevs interest in entering politics leads to these two becoming incredibly close much to the discomfort of balakrishna and ram bharat meanwhile  his political favors with the congress masters reap him reward as he wins contracts of food processing plants but soon  due to not paying workers at divya pharmacy minimum wage they draw the ire of citu brinda karat soon claims that the workers brought her testicles of some sort of wildcat apparently they told her deer horns and human skulls were crushed into the medicines though there is no proof to validate this  the samples tested by the union health ministries ayurvedic unit  ayush confirmed traces of human and animal dna karat apparently met nd tiwari but according to her the minister didnt budge to take any action soon ramdev starts to do roadshows across the country and abroad patanjali ayurved ltd is born over the controversial divya pharmacy and here we see the next mystery the disappearance of 77 year old tb infested shankar mahadev  ramdevs guru  mahadev was becoming quite vocal and anxious about the venture of ramdev and his deputies police find nothing but a note in his room saying i have taken some loan from you for this trust but i cannot pay it please forgive me i am leaving ramdev who was on a foreign trip didnt cut it short as would have been expected  ramdev and rajeev dixit set up a new party  bharat swabhiman andolan  the takeover of aastha  when sebi freezes 93 of aasthas owners share  sensing an opportunity ramdev moves in and buys the remaining 7 for 10 crores in installment the installments were never paid  but the ownership was transferred to ramdev part of this was done in faith once the formalities are done  in a confrontational meeting  ramdev bullies the owner and md into resignation meanwhile  he asks another follower to buy sanskar channel for him which that follower did as mentioned earlier  keeping inline with ramdevs political ambitions  rajeev dixit and ramdev became increasingly close much to dismay of balakrishna and ram bharat soon  rajeev dixit was found dead in a locked bathroom the hospital said it was cardiac arrest ramdev said on television that he had told rajeev to take care of his health as he had diabetes  bp and heart disease but rajeevs brother pradeep says that he had no such health problems next  ramdev convinces the family to conduct funeral in haridwar as dixit was son of the soil instead of his native wardha but as his body was laid for public demonstration  the bharat swabhiman andolan workers were stunned dixits face was unrecognizable  strange purple and blue his skin was peeling strangely there was black  blue blood coming from his nose soon there was hue and cry the andolan workers wanted to conduct post mortem ramdev called a few of them for a personal meeting  confiscated their phones  checked their pens for cameras and told them that post mortem is against hindu dharma when they refused to budge  ramdev agreed but soon went back to the hall ahead of the workers and spoke on microphone some people have come from mumbai they want me to do a post mortem such cutting is against hindu dharma soon ramdevs men got the body ready and set off to cremation ghats ramdevs biggest fall came during his participation in the anna movement he wanted to use the movement for his political mileage hence while the original protesters were focused on a stronger lokpal bill  ramdev was more about bringing black money back so he sat on a fast onto death protest meanwhile there was a backdoor meeting with senior congress members  pranab mukerjee  pk bansal  kapil sibal and subodh kant sahay  he then agreed to something and then went ahead and did the exact opposite this ired the congress as at midnight the cops swooped on the protestors with lathi charge ramdev of course famously tried to escape dressed in a white salwar kameez part of the credit towards the success of patanjali should go to their exceo  sk patra he helped them lay the foundations  setup best practices for what was a highly disoriented company with no ethics or standard operating procedures patra also used his connections to stabilize against the witchhunting on ramdevs business enterprises by the congress govt but soon patras influence once again made balakrishna and ram bharat uneasy patra was let off after some ugly confrontation with baba  today patanjali is the second largest fmcg company with revenue of rs 10561 crores its best selling products are ghee  rs 1467 crore  dant kanti toothpaste  rs 940 crore but patanjali ghee isnt normal ghee but actually white butter which is not really good for health caravan has published a transcript from the book on this section   link  http  wwwcaravanmagazinein vantage patanjalisdesicowgheeevencowghee  part of the reason for patanjalis market share is its

reading the bookedit 1 formattingedit 2 woah thanks for the gold kind stranger though i would rather have people reading the book while indian non fiction writing and publishing are much to be desired  ventures like these must be encouraged that will allow us to see similar good books that talk about interesting men  policies  events etc ,rahultheinvader, dude  thank you this was really good when you mentioned in that thread i knew id never read the book but i did want to know a gist   op that delivers is the best kind of op  http  iimgurcom tyu0m4yjpg ps  authors take on this book  id be

copy im more than halfway through the book now  this guy is no swami  hes not even a hard nosed businessman  hes a mobsteredit finished the book a while back  thought i should update took less than three hours to read  was interesting enough to read in one sitting not badly written at all  saw the author went to columbia to study journalism  it shows in the tight narrative and objective stance its clear that the author wanted to cover the less seen perspective  which makes this more of an investigative journalism piece than a biography its taken some effort to put this all together  but its not a multi year ground breaking effort nevertheless very timely  and shows the murky underbelly lala ramdev is incredibly ambitious  and since ambition is violence  hes quite ruthless and violent its a psych profile  probably true for many ceos and top politicians who have all been found to have psychopathic tendencies   http  timecom 32647 whichprofessionshavethemostpsychopathsthefewest  its a rags to riches story of ruthless ambition also an example of what yoga without yama niyama  dos and donts  can do  it can provide incredible energy for mischief even before reading this  i never trusted in ramdev as a spiritual godman  but still didnt actively disapprove of him since i just considered him to be a businessmanbut reading your post has made me realize that he is a pretty terrible human being who feeds off the faith of the gulliblethanks for the post mate you have completely changed my perceptiontl dr new shit has come to light i do not know the truth behind the facts presented in that book but based on what you have written it seems that this baba knows how to gain peoples trust and then punishes them for trusting him in a way he is teaching them all a lesson for trusting him by exploiting their weaknessesfor example  shankar dev and karamveer seem to have had very high ideals and when they wanted to hand pick somebody to carry on their legacy out of all the people they chose ramdev it shows that these people were terrible at judging who is a real disciple and who is not this is fucking scary man fuck op  this is great i had always known there was something behind rajeev dixits death just like he says to boycott chinese goods  i think we should all boycott patanjali goods  gangs of wasseypur wali feeling aati hai story padh karthis is scary af side of this fmcg empire so as expected  this baba is nothing but a fraud who built his empire on top of lies  deceit and murdersthank you op somebody need to make a hindi tldr thanks for the summary  was looking for a kindle version and couldnt find great that you pointed to the app by juggernaut mf businessman now no buying of his products future anurag kashyap movie  top class post  one of the coolest reads someone should make a series like narcos on him i want baba ramdev mobile phone all made with haridwar hardware ecologically friendly and swadeshi any proofs in the book? great job op and nice summary you have already done good work but if you added the timeline it will be more helpful in keeping things into perspective though not surprising at all there are a few interesting

Business/Finance,i find r india circlejerking too much over shashi tharoor whenever he reproaches the evils of the british raj here is an alternative perspective from gurcharan das  non political ,163,6zeuk0,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6zeuk0/i_find_rindia_circlejerking_too_much_over_shashi/,115,here is the original link of the articlehttps  gurcharandasorg richnationpoorindia how a rich nation became poor and will be rich againessays  march 19  2007  1238 developing cultures  case studies  coedited by peter berger and laurence harrison  routledge  2005 does culture in some way help to explain the fact that the same indian economy that was stagnating for the first fifty years of the 20th century began to grow at a respectable clip after 1980 and was amongst the fastest growing in the world by the end of the century?consider the following hundred year trend between 1900 and 1950  the indian economy grew on the average 08 percent a year  but the population also grew at about the same rate  thus  net growth in income per capita was nil and we rightly called our colonial economy stagnant after independence  economic growth picked up to 35 percent between 1950 and 1980  but so did population growth  to 22 percent   hence the net affect on income was 13 percent per capita  and this is what we mournfully referred to as the hindu rate of growth things began to change with modest liberalization in the eighties when annual economic growth rose to 56 percent this happy trend continued in the reform decade of the nineties when growth averaged 62 percent a year  while population slowed to 18 percent  thus  per capita income rose by a decent 44 percent a yearas a benchmark  recall that the wests industrial revolution took place at a 3 percent gdp growth and 11 percent per capita income growth after 1820 to appreciate the magnitude of the indian change after 1980  let me illustrate if indias per capita gdp had continued growing at the pre1980 level  then its income would have reached present american capita income levels only by 2250  but if it continues to grow at the post1980 rate then it will reach those levels by 2066 a gain of 184 yearshow does one begin to explain indias economic performance over the past hundred years? the indian nationalist blames the first fifty years stagnation on british colonialism but a trade economist will counter this by showing that the world economy was also stagnant in the first half of the 20th century  especially after world war i  when world per capita gdp grew annually at just under one percent2the main culprits  he would say  were conflict and autarky disgraceful protectionism by most governments between the wars slowed both the world and the indian economyalthough the indian economy picked up after 1950  the neoclassical economist would argue that it performed below the world economy  which experienced a golden age driven by trade expansion until 1971 like the rest of the third world india did not benefit from global trade expansion because it had closed its economy and pursued import substitution moreover  nehrus socialism had shackled the economy with fierce controls on the private sector  pejoratively called licence raj  hence its annual gdp growth was 15 percentage points below even the third world average between 1950 and 19803this changed dramatically with modest liberal reforms in the 1980s and more sweeping ones in the 1990s as the indian economy integrated with the world in those twenty years it not only outperformed the world economy significantly but it was amongst the fastest in the world4thus  gradual technological diffusion  rising capital accumulation and productivity  and gradual education expansion help economists to explain a good deal of the story there is also the value of time and accumulated learning through time collective learning is hayeks term  and he applied it to the cumulative experience that generations build up which is embodied in the language  the technology  and the way of doing things5but economic explanations are not enough that india adopted democracy in 1950 before capitalism  in 1991  is also significant because democracys redistributive pressures  such as free power to farmers and other subsidies  have dampened growth and also explain why indias reform process has been so painfully slow economists also find it puzzling why the liberal institutions of the british raj did not engender faster growth during the colonial years the rule of law  the relative peace of pax brittanica  a nondirigiste administration  the railways and canalsall these were market friendly moves  after alli believe that national confidence also plays an important role the more damaging impact of colonialism may well have been to indian mindsit created an inferiority complex from which they have only recently recovered douglass north has rightly emphasized the importance of beliefs6businessmen understand the value of confidence in entrepreneurial success and in creating a climate for investment  historians too emphasize the power of selfbelief in national successroman history and britains rise in the 19th century are examples of this after independence  indias confidence certainly rose  especially as democracy took root  but flawed economic institutions of nehruvian socialism damaged that confidence once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the reform period  confidence returned and young indian minds finally became decolonized i traveled extensively across india in the 1990s when i discovered this changed mood  and i think it also explains the current economic success7i shall now amplify my arguments by taking the reader on a galloping tour of indian economic history from this story i shall draw lessons about the role of institutions and culture in development en passant  i shall touch upon the great questions of indian history did the british impoverish india? why didnt the railways engender an industrial revolution? did nehrus socialism dampen indias progress? what is the consequence of democracy preceding capitalism?lets begin with the mughalsindias nationalist historians have portrayed its precolonial economy as a golden age of prosperity  and this fabulous wealth set the europeans on their great voyages of discovery8during the mughal empire at the end of the 16th century  indias wealth did indeed sustain more than 100 million people with plenty of arable land  its agriculture was certainly as productive as western europes  and even the subsistenceoriented peasant got a decent return9india also had a large  skilled workforce that produced not only cotton but also luxuries for the aristocracy consequently  the economy produced a large financial surplus  which was used to support the growing mughal empire and finance spectacular monuments like the taj mahal10in 1497  the portuguese sent vasco da gama with a flotilla of four ships to find indias wealth but the twoyear voyage was not a commercial success and the indians were not interested in european clothes and goods for they made far ones in india but da gama told king manuel of portugal of large cities  large buildings and rivers  and great populations he spoke about spices and jewels  precious stones and mines of gold he believed that he had found indias legendary wealth11it took the english a hundred years to discover this wealth initially  they came to plunder but soon discovered the rewards of trade they found that india produced the worlds best cotton yarn and textiles and in enormous quantities12what the indians wanted in exchange from the europeans was gold and silver  for which they had an insatiable appetite hence  there was a constant flow of gold to india  which absorbed a good deal of the bullion mined by the spaniards in the new world having learned about cotton textiles from india  the english turned the tables  and brought an industrial revolution to britain  but destroyed the lives of millions of indian weaversindia was a leading manufacturer in the 18th centuryindia was a leading manufacturing country in the world in the early 18th century it had 226 percent share of the worlds gdp  which came down to around 16 percent by 1820  closer to its share of world population13it had a developed banking system and vigorous merchant capital  with a network of agents  brokers and middlemen given the enormous financial surplus  a skilled artisan class  large exports  plenty of arable land and reasonable productivity  the question is why didnt a modern industrial economy emerge in india? instead  why did india become impoverished?despite a dynamic and a growing commercial sector which responded to market forces and extensive foreign trade  the truth is that 18th century india was significantly behind western europe in technology  institutions and ideas neither an agricultural revolution  nor a scientific revolution had occurred  and in the long run the manual skill of the indian artisan could be no substitute for technological progress 14and this would have needed new attitudes notwithstanding the surplus and the trade  mideighteenth india had a per capita product perhaps twothirds of that in england and france15there is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor one explanation is that even in the 18th century india had a large population and plenty of cheap labor prosperity comes with rising productivity and a rise in productivity depends on technology when the supply of labor is elastic  it is more economical to hire people than to invest in machines hence  an englishman observed in 1807  in india it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labour16there is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor one explanation is that even in the 18 century india had a large population and plenty of cheap labor prosperity comes with rising productivity and a rise in productivity depends on technology when the supply of labor is elastic  it is more economical to hire people than to invest in machines hence  an englishman observed in 1807  in india it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labourdid the british raj impoverish india?indias nationalist historians have blamed the british raj for indias poverty the classic nationalist case is that india had been rich before the british came and colonialism weakened agriculture and deindustrialized india  throwing millions of artisans out of work britains trade policies encouraged the import of manufactures and the export of raw materials  finally  it drained the wealth of india by transferring its capital to britainnationalists claimed that lancashires new textile mills crushed indias handloom textile industry and threw millions of weavers out of work indias textile exports plunged from a leadership position before the start of the britains industrial revolution to a fraction the indigenous banking system  which financed these exports  was also destroyed since the colonial government did not erect tariff barriers  indian consumers shifted to cheaper english millmade cloth and millions of handloom workers where left in misery british colonial rule deindustrialised india  a favorite nationalist phrase  and from an exporter of textiles  india became an exporter of raw cotton17britain also changed the old land revenue system to the disadvantage of the farmer  who had to now pay revenue whether or not the monsoon failed this led to famines the worst one in 189697 affected 96 million lives and killed an estimated 5 million people although the railways helped in the trade of food crops  the enlarged national market sucked away the peasants surplus  which he had earlier stored for the bad years moreover  the british government transferred its surplus revenues back to england since india consistently exported more then she imported in the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century  britain used indias trade surplus to finance her own trade deficit with the rest of the world  to pay for her exports to india  and for capital repayments in london this represented a massive drain of indias wealth18in recent years some historians have challenged this nationalist picture they have argued that indian industrys decline in the 19th century was caused by technology the machines of britains industrial revolution wiped out indian textiles  in the same way that traditional handmade textiles disappeared in europe and the rest of the world fifty years later indian textile mills would have destroyed them indias weavers were  thus  the victims of technological obsolescence19they also found that the land tax had not been exorbitantby 1900 it was only 5 percent of the agricultural output or half the average per capita tax burden there had been a drain of wealth  but it was only about 15 percent of gnp every year the revisionist historians argued that indias payments to britain were for real military and civilian services and to service capital investments also  the overhead cost of the british establishmentthe so called home chargeswas in fact quite small20if india had its own army and navy it would have spent more true  india did have a balance of payments surplus  which britain used to finance part of her deficit  but india was compensated by the import of gold and silver that went into private indian handsindia begins to reindustrizeindian entrepreneurs began to set up their own modern textile mills after 1850 and very slowly began to recapture the domestic market in 1896  indian mills supplied 8 of the total cloth consumed in india  in 1913  20  in 1936  62  and by 1945  7621although india did not participate in global trade expansion between 1870 and 1913  indian businessmen made large profits during the first world war  which they reinvested in after the war thus  indias manufacturing output grew 56 percent per year between 191338  well above the world average of 33 percent22the british government finally provided tariff protection from the 1920s  which helped industrialists to expand and diversifyby independence in 1947  indian entrepreneurs were strong and in a position to buy out the businesses of the departing british industrys share in indias gnp had doubled from 38 percent  in 1913  to 75 percent  in 1947   and the share of manufactures in her exports rose from 224 percent  in 1913  to 30 percent  in 1947 why didnt an industrial revolution occur?one of the intriguing questions of history is why india failed to create an industrial revolution karl marx predicted that the railways would transform india and usher in an industrial revolution indeed  by the first world war  some thought that it was ready to takeoff by 1914  india had the third largest railway network  the worlds largest jute manufacturing industry  the fourth largest cotton textile industry  the largest canal system  and 25 percent of world trade23although a colony  it had a very liberal regulatory regimefar more investor friendly than the one that replaced it after independenceand after the 1920s the infant industry was also favored by tariffs it had a merchant class hungry to become industrialists industrialization did  in fact  pick up after the war and industrys share in national output doubled but it was not enough to broadly transform an agricultural society modern industry employed only 25 million people out of population of 350 millionamiya kumar bagchi  the marxist economist  suggests that the reason was the lack of effective demand during the colonial period  and this limited business opportunity indians were just too poor to buy modern goods and services24if the domestic indian market was small  couldnt the entrepreneur have supplemented it by producing for export? morris d morris  blames supply constraints25an indian entrepreneur was uncompetitive because of a shortage of technology  skilled labor  and capitalall of which raised his cost of his production the historian  rajat ray  argues that indian businessmen did not export because they made inferior products  unacceptable to the world market in his view  technological backwardness was the single biggest failing26but surely  they could have imported technology  as jamshedji tata  gd birla  and others didunlike nationalist historians  i do not think there was a british conspiracy to deliberately underinvest in india or sabotage indian business interests bombays textile mills were built with the credit  technical assistance and machines from britain although they were a competitive threat to the manchesters mills i believe the industrial revolution did not occur because indian agriculture remained stagnant  and you cannot have an industrial revolution without an agricultural surplus or the means to feed a rapidly growing urban population  second  the international trading environment turned hostile with protectionism after the first world war  followed by the depression  third  the colonial government did not educate the masses  unlike the japanese state  finally  a colonial mindset pervaded the indian middle classeven the hardiest potential entrepreneur lacks confidence when he is politically enslavedwhat is the verdict on british rule?did the british impoverish india? there is no question that in the 18th century it plundered and looted indias wealth  as all conquerors have done in history but did it create ongoing institutions that were to indias detriment? this has to do with the nature and theory of colonialism true  its industrial revolution threw millions of weavers out of work  but it would have happened any way when the new technology reached india british government policy could have cushioned the impact by erecting trade barriers and saved enormous amount of human suffering  but protecting handlooms would have been a temporary palliativeodd as it may seem  i believe that britain did not exploit india enough had it made the massive investments in india that it did in the americas  india would have become more prosperous and a much bigger market for british goods a richer india would have been a better customer  a better supplier  and a firmer basis of empire27britains main failure was not to educate the indian masseshence 83 percent of indians were illiterate at independence britains education system in india produced only a thin upper crust of extremely well educated indians  while the masses remained illiterate28although britain could not lift indians out of poverty  nor avert famines  it did give india the institutions of democracythe rule of law  an independent judiciary and a free press it built railways  canals  and harbors it gave india almost a hundred years of peacethe pax britannica although it gave modern values and institutions  it did not interfere with its ancient traditions and religion hence  india has preserved its spiritual heritage and the old way of life continues many despair over the divisiveness of caste  but the hold of the indian way of life is also a bulwark against the onslaught of the global cultureindependence and license rajafter independence  democracy took root in india and gradually the masses acquired a stake in the system  periodically electing representatives even from the lowest castes the rulers also adopted a fabian socialist economic path  and indians did not turn to capitalism until 1991  although there was modest liberalization of the economy in the 1980s thus  india embraced democracy before capitalism  which makes its journey to modernity unique and explains a good dealjawaharlal nehru and his planners did not trust private entrepreneurs  so they made the state the entrepreneur  and not surprisingly  they failed to create an industrial revolution instead  india experienced an agricultural revolution in the early 1970s it thus had an important precondition for the industrial revolutionan agricultural surplusbut the industrial takeoff eluded it its investment rate also rose from 6 percent to well over 20 per cent  and yet it did not engender a takeoff why?i think there were at least six things wrong with indias mantra one  it adopted an inwardlooking  importsubstituting path rather than an outwardlooking  exportpromoting route  it thus denied itself a share in world trade and the prosperity that trade brought in the postwar era two  it set up a massive  inefficient  and monopolistic public sector to which it denied autonomy of working  hence  its investments were not productive and it had a poor capitaloutput ratio three  it overregulated private enterprise with the worst controls in the world  and this diminished competition in the market  four  it discouraged foreign capital and denied itself the benefits of technology and world class competition five  it pampered organized labor to the point that it has extremely low productivity six  it ignored the education of its childrennehrus strategic planner  pc mahalanobis  made two wrong assumptions he assumed that there were no opportunities for rapid export expansion in the 1950s  and this turned out to be wrong india discovered that tiny hong kong could earn more from its exports than the whole of india  as indias share of world trade declined from 22 percent in 1947 to 05 percent in 1990 he also assumed that competition was wasteful  and this was also a flawed idea because there can be little improvement in productivity without iteven more damaging were the creeping controls on the private sector the most bizarre was the licensing system it began with the industrial licensing act of 1951  which required an entrepreneur to get a license to set up a new unit  to expand it  or change the product mix a huge number of untrained clerks  engineers  bureaucrats at the directorate general of technical development  operating on the basis of inadequate information vetted thousands of applications on an ad hoc basis these low level functionaries took months in the futile  microreview of an application and finally sent it for approval to the administrative ministry the ministry again lost months reviewing the same data before it sent the application to an interministerial licensing committee after the ministers approval  the investor had to seek approval for the import of machinery from the capital goods licensing committee if finance was needed from a state financial institution  the same scrutiny had to be repeated afresh the result was enormous delays  sometimes lasting years with staggering opportunities for corruptionlarge business houses set up parallel bureaucracies in delhi  to follow up on their files  organize bribes  and win licenses if the entrepreneur did finally get started and made a success of his enterprise  he was again in trouble it was an offence punishable under the law to manufacture beyond the capacity granted by the license india became the only country in the world where the production of sorely needed goods sorely was punishable by law29the system ended in thwarting competition  entrepreneurship and growth  without achieving any of its social objectives it fostered monopolies and it proliferated uneconomicsize plants in remote  uncompetitive locations  employing secondrate technology bureaucrats who did not have a clue about the basics of running a business made the decisions on the choice of technology  the size and location of plantsalthough it was becoming clear that india was on the wrong path by the late sixties  instead of changing course after nehru  indira gandhi introduced more controls she nationalized banks  discouraged foreign investment  and placed more hurdles before domestic enterprise hence  industrial growth plunged from 77 per cent a year between 19511965 to 40 per cent between 19661980 productivity of indian manufacturing declined half a percent a year from 1960 to 19853019661980 is effectively the dark period for the indian economy31 it is harder to blame nehru for adopting the economic wrong model for socialism was the wisdom of his age and dozens of economists visited india and hailed his bold experiment32it is right to blame indira gandhi  for by then japans miracle was evident  and korea and taiwan were following its footsteps however  ideology is only one part of the story an important reason for nonperformance was poor implementation even nehrus socialism could have delivered more and did not have to degenerate into license rajindia after the reformsalthough there was modest liberalization in the 1980s  the decisive turning point came in july 1991 when the minority government of narasimha rao announced sweeping reforms it opened the economy to foreign investment and trade  it dismantled import controls  lowered customs duties  devalued the currency and made the rupee convertible on the trade account  it virtually abolished licensing controls on private investment  dropped tax rates and broke public sector monopolies as a result growth rose to 75 percent a year for three years in a row in the midnineties  inflation came down from 13 percent to 6 percent by 1993  exchange reserves shot up from 1 billion to 20 billion by 1993  and had crossed 100 billion by end 2003 this was as important a turning point as dengs revolution in china in december 1978 surprisingly  the elected coalition governments that succeeded rao continued the reform process  and despite its slow  incremental pace  it has made india one of the fastest growing major economies in the world33indians have traditionally not accorded a high place to making money hence  the merchant or bania is placed third in the fourcaste hierarchy  behind the brahmin and the kshatriya  and only a step ahead of the laboring shudra after the economic reforms making money became increasingly respectable and the sons of brahmins and kshatriyas began to get mbas and wanted to become entrepreneurs the business pages of newspapers became livelier  chief ministers in the states scrambled for private investment  judges became more evenhanded in industrial disputes as a result  india is in the midst of a social revolution rivalled  perhaps  only by the ascent of japans merchant class during the 1968 meiji restorationthere has also been mental revolution and a changed attitude to english illustrates this new mindset ever since the british left indians constantly carped against the english language but in the 1990s this carping seemed to die  and quietly  without ceremony english became one of the indian languages english lost its colonial stigma  oddly enough  around the time that the hindu nationalists came to power young indians in the new middle class think of english as a skill  like windows this is why hinglish  hindi mixed with english  is spreading encouraged by flourishing private television channels and supported by their advertisers  the newly emerging middle classes avidly embrace this uninhibited hybrid of hindi and english  and this popular idiom of the bazaar is rushing down the socioeconomic ladder the purists naturally disapprove  but people are more comfortable and accepting of it today because indians are more relaxed and confident as a people their minds have become decolonizedthe world  meanwhile  also changed from an industrial to the information economy  and it seemed to speak to indias advantage  symbolized by its success in software and business process outsourcing these bangalores have given indians confidence and they reflect a new social contract the new entrepreneurs did not inherit wealth  they have risen on the back of their talent  hard work  and professional skills a new selfbelief has emerged among urban youth that doesnt need approval from others  especially from the west music composers like ar rehman display an exuberant nonchalance  as do the new young bollywood pop stars so do new fiction writers like arundhati roy  designers of fashion clothes  beauty queens and cricket starssome lessonsneoclassical economic theory explains a great deal about why the indian economy that was stagnating in the first half of the 20th century went on to become one of the fastest growing by the end of the century it tells us  for example  that disgraceful protectionism by governments in the interwar years in the first half of the 20th century dampened world trade and slowed down the world and the indian economies it also explains why india performed below the world average between 19501980 thinking that trade had impoverished her in the colonial period  india closed its economy and denied itself the fruits of a golden period in world trade between 1950 and 1970  license raj and other institutions of nehrus socialism also suppressed growth finally  neoclassical economics explains how by dismantling controls and integrating the economy with the global economy  the indian economy has become more competitive and is growing rapidly after the reformsbut this is not the whole story  and we must turn to institutions and attitudes to understand the incentive structure of the indian society60 indians blame colonialism for impoverishing them but we have seen that colonialism is a more complex tale for example  it did not deindustrialize india as the nationalists argued  handloom textiles died in india  and the world  because of technological obsolescence colonialisms bigger damage was to the loss of indian confidence  which inhibited indian entrepreneurs this confidence began to grow with gandhis freedom movement in the first half of the 20th century  and industrialization did pick up however  its impact on society was insufficient to create an industrial revolutionafter independence  indias confidence certainly rose as democracy took root  but flawed economic institutions of nehruvian socialism acted as a damper once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the reform period  selfassurance returned to the indian marketplace todays mood in india is opposite to what existed a hundred years ago insecurity and inferiority filled colonial india  which is all too apparent in the writings of bengali writers of the 19th century  such as bankim chandra chatterji today  writers like salman rushdie and arundhati roy exhibit a matter of fact assuredness  almost a cool  that is a reflection of changed national mindsetindia embraced democracy first and capitalism afterwards and this has made a difference india became a fullfledged democracy in 1950  with universal suffrage and extensive human rights  but it was not until 1991 that it opened up to the free play of market forces for the rest of the world it has been the other way around in the west  suffrage was extended gradually in the last century  and as mass political parties developed  democracy began to impinge on capitalist institutions and practicesindias democracy has an overwhelming majority of poor voters70 per cent still live in rural areas  organized labor constitutes less than 10 per cent of total labor  and the middle class is around 20 per cent of the population because of democratic pressures  india tried to redistribute the pie before it was baked it set up intricate regulatory networks before the private economy had transformed a rural into an industrial society it began to think in terms of welfare before there were welfaregenerating jobs the result  as we have seen  was a throttling of enterprise  slow growth  and missed opportunities it is the price india has paid for having democracy before capitalismor rather too much democracy and not enough capitalismsince politics is a short run game and growth is a long run one there will never be a situation that is completely optimal this explains why indian politicians do not bother about education because results take a long time to come when a politician promises rice for two rupees a kilo when it costs five rupees in the market  he wins the election since the mid1960s politicians have vigorously competed in giving away free goods and services to voters when politicians do that  where is the money to come for creating schools or improving old ones? indias damaging fiscal deficit  around 10 percent of gdp for the center and states combined  is a testimonial to the downside of competitive politics  and it teaches that the demand for publicly provided goods and services is insatiable in a democracybut indias problems of governance go far beyond the need to appease interests the weakening of its democratic institutions since indira gandhi in the 1970s has caused widespread corruption  political violence  populist giveaways  and a paralysis of problem solving conspicuously absent are disciplined party organizations  which help leaders in other democracies to mobilize support for specific programs hence  there is an excessive reliance on the personal appeal of individual leaders to win elections when in power leaders tend to take the easy way out  which is not to act at allwill capitalism  and its cousin globalization succeed in establishing a comfortable place for themselves in india? the answer depends on their ability to deliver prosperity broadly it also depends on leaders in the government and in business to champion the classic liberal premises of free trade and competition it needs leaders to come out say that  1  some people will not fare as well in the competitive market place   2  the winners will far outnumber the losers   2  capitalist democracy is the best arrangement we have found   4  globalization is not only a good thing  it is a great leap forward in history my fear is that capitalisms success in india is threatened not so much by the leftists or protectionists but by the timidity of its defendersthe curious historic inversion between democracy and capitalism means that indias path into the future is evolving through a daily dialogue between the conservative forces of caste  religion and the village  the leftist and nehruvian socialist forces which dominated the intellectual life of the country for 40 years  and the new forces of global capitalism these million negotiations of democracy slow down the pace of economic reforms  but they also mean that india might have a more stable  peaceful  and negotiated transition into the future than say china it might also avoid some of the deleterious side effects of an unprepared capitalist society  such as russia although slower  india is more likely to preserve its way of life and its civilization of diversity  tolerance  and spirituality against the onslaught of the global culturedoes culture matter?cultural explanations have been a vigorous industry in india for more than a hundred years colonial officials routinely blamed indias poverty on the otherworldly spirituality of hindu life and its fatalistic beliefs max weber attributed the absence of development to the caste system gunnar myrdal  the swedish economist  found that indias social system and attitudes were an important cause of its low level equilibrium of low productivity  primitive production techniques  and low levels of living34deepak lal  another economist  similarly explained economic stagnation in a low level hindu equilibrium around the caste system  which bought stability in the context of political warfare  monsoon failure and climatic uncertainty  labor shortage  and an undervalued merchant class35david landes  the historian  blames the enervating heat  which is deleterious to work for this reason  rich countries lie in temperate zones and the poor in the tropics and semitropics36while institutions and culture do matter undoubtedly  we are all skeptical of national stereotypes and easy cultural explanations of the sort that were common hundred years ago in my experience  successful hindu entrepreneurs can be both extremely otherworldly in religion and aggressive in business the indian farmer  despite being caught in the caste system  responds quickly to market based incentives  as the green revolution testifies brahmins  who are supposed to have contempt for manual labor  will plough their land vigorously if they have to and rajput thakurs  who never worked for a living  will shed their feudal ways for the sake of a commercial opportunity moreover  there are substantial nonhindus in india and these communities had also been stuck in the same rut of stagnation other asian countries were equally backward  but they had no hindu equilibrium to explain away their stagnation finally  the same indians when they migrate to other countries perform betterthus  i am uncomfortable with the otherworldly values of the hindus or the immobilizing effects of the caste system and the conservative habits of the merchant caste i believe that sir john hicks economic principle does trump in most cases it states that people would act economically  when the opportunity of an advantage was presented to them they would take it37it explains not only the diffusion of the green revolution across india but also the demographic transitions currently underway in many stateswhen seeking an explanation for a nations wealth and poverty  my preferred method is to begin with economic factors as proximate causes that motivate a businessman to investthe size of the market  the capability of suppliers  distribution hurdles  and the state of competition if this does not satisfy  i seek answers in institutions  some of which are  of course  intimately tied to culture i have found that institutions can evolve rapidly as incentives change in society and can be transferred fairly quickly  for example  during the 1990s india was able to dismantle many of the institutions of nehruvian socialism and replace them with capitalist institutions finally  if none of these factors provide a satisfactory explanation  then i turn to attitudes and social structurei find deepak lalls distinction between material and cosmological beliefs useful38the material beliefs of a civilization are about ways of making a living and are the subject of economics  cosmological ones are about how to live and are in the realm of culture the rise of the west was accompanied by a change in both sets of beliefs  but east asias success has needed mainly a change in material beliefsit has become prosperous without losing its soul in other words  it is possible to modernize without westernizing ever since the british raj material beliefs have been changing in india unlike our cosmological beliefsour continuing inability to distinguish between the modern and the western in india is surely the cause of some of our grief if we could only accept that a great deal of modern western culture  especially its material beliefs  are not the wests property  but are a universal  critical way of thinking  which belongs to all rational human beings we would not waste our energies on swadeshi  protectionism  hindutva  preserving the ancient hindu civilization   and futile language debates  remove english from primary schools  the debate between modernisation and westernisation  begun in early nineteenth century by ram mohan roy  continues to rage in india at the root is a fear of the loss of the indian way of life the older generation fears it more than the young  whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the wests material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones,unfitforoffice, wow tldr?  deleted   deleted  i dont think thats what tharoor is really talking about more from the perspective of hitler is taught to be an evil guy now in germany as well yet  britain has mostly whitewashed the horrors theyve committed in what they teach to their own kids continuing the same stuff  imho  hes raising awareness about the atrocities that theyve committed  and thats something i can get behind i think tharoors main goal is to educate the modern western masses about some of the harsher realities of colonialism  that they conveniently leave out in their history text books this was an interesting counter narrative as well das essentially wrote the same thing in india unbound but i dont think it really contradicts tharoors claims  everyone of das arguments are well corroborated in partly being responsible for holding india back but he lets the brits go scott freeyes  there were individual entrepreneurial success stories  too few benefited  yes  the european institutions enabled the industrial revolution and yes  the caste system was responsible but without a indian structural head who couldve changed things or we couldve had an enlightment  a historical whatif   the colonial masters simply gave  no chance for growth that carries a lot of culpability the drain theory is definitely true the eic was paying 400 000 pounds to the crown since 1765 apart from the gifts to parliament all sourced from india they took advantage of aurgazebs tax exemption the marathas  nawab of awadh and hyderabads nizam all had to pay substantial amounts annually to the french and eic well before 1857 asafuddaula paid 76 million rupees annually just to be recognised nawab in 1797 the point is  the money couldve been spent on subjects or institutions and maybe we wouldnt be as poor as we are nowa book came out last year called selling empire india in the making of britain and america  16001830 which demonstrates the centrality of indiaboth as an idea and a placeto the making of a global british imperial system essentially  the new world was discovered because columbus was searching for riches in india he makes the argument that in the runup to the american revolution  the east india company played a visible and disturbing role in his view  americans awareness of the companys conquests in india  and the establishment of an authoritarian government there  evoked the fear of a shared place for indians and americans in a corrupt and despotic empire  following the revolution  americas connection with india paradoxically expanded  as reflected in part by the continuing appeal of indian consumer fashions much of it  however  arose fortuitously out of the extended british wars with france from 1794 onward  as a neutral power  the united states was well situated to take advantage of trading opportunities denied to others by 1806  india had contributed 4 percent of us imports  and americans commanded much of the continental european market for indian goods  it gave india almost a hundered years of peace im done i wouldnt call 100+ of looting and injustice peaceful have read the whole thingthe nehruvian disaster is irrelevant for judging the british periodtaking information from the article itself  i think we can still blame the british for not letting india join the industrial revolutionthis they did by creatinglow literacy education  in a modern economy  this alone will mean that youll fail to compete unstable political environment  low confidence  in an uncertain future  why will anyone invest time and capital  there is a mention of low self confidence and lack of education being the reason indians didnt moved toward industrialization and he also mentioned that indians had no money to buy anything at that time then how after 1947 suddenly things could have changed? isnt these things require time especially a skills gained after education i think once a generation of indian educated enough in 1980s they automatically moved towards the industrialization solely on the basis of there skills and of course we cant deny the poor government policies but i feel completely blaming them isnt right  a thing is there something wrong i have understood from this article? saved for later too long to read right now lets just sum it up the british did many good things and bad thingspersonally im glad for stuff like outlawing sati and reforming personal laws which im sure most of our post independence governments wouldnt have the guts to touch was india ever a rich nation in the first place? people use the 27 of world gdp stat to justify the label but we had 27 of the world population also at that time both shashi tharoor and gurcharan das are starting from the flawed premise that we were a rich nation  slightly off topic  but i believe much of tharoors british bashing is just shrewd political posturing when he first ran for parliament in 2009  the nair community voted for him en masse because he is one of us the educated liberal class voted for him because he had the it factor  undersecretary general of the un  erudite  sophisticated etc he won handily  with a huge margin in 2014  a lot of the older nairs voted bjp because they stand for hindu values  evidence for this is anectodal  everyone in my  +wifes  family voted tharoor in 2009  most of our parents generation voted bjp in 2014  tharoor still had the youth liberal vote and won  but by a margin that was an order of magnitude less compared to 2009 a huge slide in 2019  he faces the prospect of running against suresh gopi  popular actor  current bjp rs mp   and stands a real risk of losing i consider his antibrit stance an attempt at pandering to the nationalistic crowdit is really simplistic to claim britain looted us or caused millions of deaths due to famine without considering how much of indias wealth was concentrated in the hands of zamindars  nawabs and rajas or taking into account the lives lost in wars between the various kingdoms and city states that dotted the indian subcontinent before the british brought it all together well tharoor is not completely wrong either india was rich  maybe not as rich as all those whatsapp forwards mention like 27 of world gdp and other crap i also believe that tharoors fans are a little bit exaggerating his debates and speeches i think hes going to use this wave of false patriotism thats been around which makes people patriots on social media  to his advantage in the next elections i mean  no one really discusses if a robbery is overall a good thing even if it did help turn someones life around in a positive way   the older generation fears it more than the young  whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the wests material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological onesas ive been trying to explain to the languagetards on all sides  accepting english is decolonization glad to see an academic agree i can drink his urine straight from source brilliant learned a lot about myself and my country  brilliant article its important to see good arguments from both sides thanks for sharing,2017-09-12 01:15:04

a farmer who commits suicide is also taking a bold step do you welcome it? committing suicide also requires courage i call it rash  reckless and adventurous step you call it bold and beautiful but the point is it has destroyed lives for nearly two to three months  millions of people stood and waited in queues to exchange their  currency  notes nearly 140 people lost their lives carpenters  rickshaw pullers  plumbers who depend on daily earning in cash went without business for two months demonetisation was a foolish step  chidambaram said at an event named samvad  which was organised by a local gujarati newspaperchidambaram also took a dig at the government  saying the note ban has failed to achieve all its stated objectives like putting an end to black money  curbing terror funding etc there is nothing like black money but merely income which is taxed and income which is taxable but escapes tax net there is a shadow economy  in india  but there is shadow economy in every other country indias shadow economy that is transactions that dont come under tax net is around 12 per cent but thats average for europe also there are many european countries which have shadow economy of more than 12 per cent even america has around eight per cent shadow economy what is shadow economy? it is income that your tax system is not able to capture the answer to shadow economy is to make your tax system more efficient if you put cruel rates of tax  people will avoid it people will say why should i pay if you make friendly tax system  they will pay the answer is not demonetisation its like saying there is a mosquito in my house  i am going to burn my whole house  he saidhe added that the introduction of gst in its present form has destroyed small and medium business as requirement for online filing three returns online per month had forced them had forced them to shut down he said these businesses were jobcreators if you invest rs1 crore in big business it wont create jobs but small and medium businesses which create jobs are struggling for survival therefore  they are not hiring and no jobs are created  he addedchidambaram also claimed that the demonetisation and the rollout of gst had dealt a severe blow to the economy  sending it into a downward spiral however  he said  the government maintains that the economy is in fine fettle day before yesterday  the finance minister  arun jaitley  said the indian economy is on strong micro economic fundamentals and the finance secretary said it was growing at 75 per cent  between 2014 and 2017 why are they announcing rs 5 lakh crore bharatmala? why are you announcing bank recapitalisation all of a sudden in your heart  you know things are not good in the last six quarters  the growth rate has gone down from 91 per cent to 57 per cent this means a drop of 34 per cent  said the congressthe former finance minister opined that it was possible to overcome the situation by taking right steps and not taking wrong steps he said that he has faith that there are people in the country who can take right steps the growth rate must not go down below 56 per cent india doesnt deserve growth rate below 57 per cent  and it is possible to take it up by taking right steps and not taking wrong steps but for that to happen  the government must acknowledge that they committed a mistake by demonetisation and gst there are people in this country who can do this government must hire from outside to correct the mistakes those in government cant do it as they are the ones who have committed the mistakes  chidambaram addedhe claimed that 1 326 farmers committed suicide in gujarat over the last four years there are no jobs today jobs will be created only if small and medium businesses grow to help them grow  small businesses should not require to register medium businesses must register but they should be given right to selfcertification  said the congress leader he said the government was talking about vikas  development  people talk about growth growth is necessary but what is the use of rojgarmukta vikas  development sans job creations  he askedthe congress leader also accused the nda government of misplaced priorities they will invest rs1 lakh crore on bullet train between mumbai and ahmedabad how many people will travel in it around 300 or 400?

Business/Finance, rant  sbi worker blames me for faulty transactions even though plenty of their customers are getting scammed,52,7yvec1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7yvec1/rant_sbi_worker_blames_me_for_faulty_transactions/,59,i received a message today about being credited with some 12k on my sbi account which confused me checked my online sbi account and realised that a week back some google octro had made a transaction of that 12k from my account which i had not realised a simple google search showed that a lot of sbi customers were also complaining about this google octro thing  also found a toi article on it  its an app on the google play store from what i understood but never mind that  i was just thankful i got my money back however  a quick advice from my father was to close my sbi account because the octro company may still have my account details and such  so there might be a risk of such fraudulent or faulty or whatever transactions to occur again ive never taken the time to manage my finances or understand how fraud transactions work so this part is probably my fault because i realised a week late that 12k was even missing from my account in the first place so i went to the bank to close my account and maybe create a new account after thatnow i am not confrontational  and i even see my faults in the whole thing but the man behind the desk was a whole different story when i went and old him id like to close my account  he looked up the statement of my transactions and i pointed out the faulty ones and he started blaming me for thosehe used a shitty ass analogy and i quote if a pick pocket steals from a person and the person doesnt realise then the blame lies on the person for not realising yea right the pickpocket is the angel here for stealing from a man carrying a wallet what the fuck is this victim blaming nonsense?? he told me i cant blame the bank for not realising i lost money except i didnt even blame the bank i only told him i wanted to close my account and gave him the reason when he asked why??and then i told him i have been busy with things plus my card was with my parents too during that time so i didnt properly check my account frequently and i realise that its my fault and then he was like of course its your fault computer wont make mistakes itll only do what its told  so if there was a mistake in telling it what to do then you shouldve realised and complained and then the icing on the cake was that he went on you youngsters are on the phone the whole day doing whatsapp yet you didnt check the transaction message i know you people are always looking at your phone and message toh aaya hi hoga tumhi ne nahi dekha all this after i explained that i know it was my fault that i didnt realisewhy are office workers in india so rude? this may seem like a small thing for many of you but i hate confrontation and avoid it as much as possible i even admitted the blame on my part and i didnt even lodge a complaint or anything but they still decide to aggressively blame and mock me for being irresponsible? lol and sbi is definitely not at all at fault even though plenty of their customers had actually suffered cause of this google octro fiascomy experience with sbi so far had been pretty decent until this incident but now im just going to go ahead and get my account closed and move to another banktldr sbi account had fraudulent transaction  got blamed for being irresponsible,anonyfried, sbi employee here i am a 25 yr oldie working in a metro branch in kolkata and i totally feel you buddy all my colleagues are patronising old fucks with no technical knowledge the clerks working cash counter are all right i guess but the clerks in back office and other desks are retarded fucks everyday i see people struggling to get petty issues sorted out  made to go upstairs  downstairs n no of times iam in credit  so cant help many of them but whoever ends up in my cabin i make it a point of sorting out their issue  but sometimes i feel so bad seeing people struggling to get their finances in order specially oldies my probation batchmates are also empathic about the situation in their branches as well things will change when the current generation in lower management ends up in senior management cadre and the oldies in award staff cadre are slowly replaced by young tech savvy and compassionate award staffs  will take a decade for sure i dont understand  how can someone transfer money from your account without your password  2nd factor of authentication? or you having given a singed direct debit authorisation? another time my brother had an education loan we were paying regularly but it didnt seem to end so we took whole account statement and tallied it with what it supposed to be there was a huge gap about 12 lacs were charged in excess when we enquired about it  the usual computer bullshit computer is not wrong  it calculates automatically  etc we said nothing doing  refund the excess charges when pressured them  they refunded 27k and said this is most they can do and i should be thankful to them for this muchwhen i tried to complain to the senior officer his reply was hum toh nahi karenge jo karna hai kar lowe went to rbi ombudsman and logged a complaint there including against this officer also rbi ombudsman seemed to be inclined towards sbi so we complained against ombudsman in rbi after 6 months we got 136 lacs back sbi is a shit bank ffswas made to come to the branch all 5 days in a week just to update my passbook  its your fault in the first place that you went to sbi expecting customer service psu banks have this patronizing attitude that they are so generous to let you keep your money with themif you want a resolution of this  file an official complaint with sbi go higher up the escalation chain write to chairman of sbi  if you have tobut more importantly  close your sbi account  and move to some good private sector bank once i was as naive as you with sbi i had a current account and i had to make an urgent neft so i reached bank by 11 they made me wait till 1230 and suddenly a douche employee comes and demands to get his work done first as his work is more important i had promised to the person that neft will get cleared by 11 and sbi people had no regards for the client i asked him about my work to which he says your work is not importantthis made me loose my temper i immediately started shouting on that asshole employee and the branch manager the building in which that branch is rented belongs to a friend i called him too  he threatened the branch manager of ending the rent lease also gave a written complaint to regional office  local head office and rbi ombudsman i made sure action was taken against himto this day that asshole sbi employee havent found his voice back change authentication settings on your mobile device to require authentication for all purchases through google play on this devicedetails https  supportgooglecom googleplay answer 1626831 faced similar behavior from indianbank officials 50 something unkills with typical  r lewronggeneration attitude fuck them one of my employees came to me in tears her salary cheque had not been credited in her sbi account even after a weeki went with her to the branch the officer looked up the account and told me that they had mistakenly credited her account twice with the amount  and then reversed the credit twice  instead of once  the officer told me that she will have her money by the end of the dayi said  nothing doing we are not leaving until you fix this right now you have kept this womans money from her for over a week you fix it right now he was a little taken aback and did so took him about half a minutemy opinion is that if you bank with a psu bank  you get what you deserve go through this ophttps  wwwsbicoin portal web customercare smsunhappy and then the icing on the cake was that he went on you youngsters are on the phone the whole day doing whatsapp yet you didnt check the transaction message i know you people are always looking at your phone and message toh aaya hi hoga tumhi ne nahi dekha all this after i explained that i know it was my fault that i didnt realisewhat if you didnt? you should have escalated the issue to manager op you are the customer  its your money and they are service providers once another sbi branch made me run for a week for a misplaced chequei asked them in writting to provide me the interest for the time periodthis made them loose their shit as this will get reflected in their balance sheet and is essentially a reason for embarrassment they inquired about me from my branch and realised their mistake when someone is rude   say to his face that he is rude and he should just do his job if he wants extra work catch  mallya   nirav modi toobe calm and dont raise your voice  it generally works my experience with sbi has generally been fine   the new recruits are fine chaps try their customer care number maybe?  they are usually a bit more helpful than the bank employees  anyway  fyi octro inc makes a popular app called teen patti its a gambling game  i would never go to the bank branch for this issue  because i know i would get this reaction  if you havent lost any money  just report your sbi global card  or whatever intl card you have  as lost and get a new one   somebody got ahold of your dc number  expiry and cvv and the bank detected the fraud and reversed the transactioni saw a news report  apparently the victim used his intl cc dc to file property tax on bmcs website maybe you used your card on an insecure website  still not your fault    personally  i find sbi to be a good bank for a checking account which you use for spending i would suggest a private account for your actual savings  larger than 10k   however i still hate private banks like icici and kotak because of stupid policies and what not  eg rants about hdfc debit cards  etc   and dbs citi stanchart hsbc only serve hni customers  yeah  if you had gone to the police  you would have gotten exactly the same treatment from the inspector victim blaming is easy for public servants  because less work for them  also tons of unsolicited advice for free the majority of indian banks have shit customer service your money is likely safe and the banks have a decent reputation  for now my advice is to move to foreign banks and move to foreign currencies if you can dont trust the indian rupeewhy are office workers in india so rude? simple answer being a working class person in india is a shit deal just grow a thicker skin op some people are always gonna be like this they have their own different frustrations in life which they take out on others ,2018-02-21 01:36:20

endeavourlacking sufficient employment opportunities  indias youth are turning to small and micro enterprises for livelihood according to the sixth economic census conducted in 201314  there were about 58 million establishments in the country  employing some 130 million workers manufacturing  retail trade and livestock farming were the top three activities as per the census in addition  the

enterprise  he needed counselling  training  and support to prepare the project report  and follow up with the financing bank the designated mentor was able to work with tamuli to obtain a loan and go on to maintain proper accounts  improve product design  link with markets lineage  manage employees  and conduct other essential business processes this can have a cascading impact as well tamuli further encouraged 300 other persons to set up business  and is now considering exports he has also ventured into training of local workers and has become a mentor himselfsuch handholding of entrepreneurs who lack the necessary knowledge is particularly important to encourage women entrepreneurship women face additional societal norms and family pressures which hinder their venturing into

no  she hasnt but she has tried for the first few years it seemed we were going back to 70s and 80s with a lot of promises made but nothing happening on ground but over the years  her effort has shown one of the major things she did right was to appoint some good capable professionals and politicians to important ministries like finance  industries  labour  agriculture  urban development and filling the rest with chamchas and career politicians as a result  economy  civic planning  tourism etc has seen excellent development in the past decade the biggest thing for me that i have seen is the patient planning  and the setting up of grounds before moving in with a major policyanother thing that gets lost in the minority appeasement rhetoric is the work that has been done for the tribals and indigenous peopleshe has also done excellent work for social welfare  especially for girls her kanyashree project  scholarship to girls from poor families  as long as they are not forcefully married before they are 18  and as long as they attend schools  along with a one time grant of 25000 rupees when the girl turns 18  has done wonders in bengal it has reduced child marriage and increased literacy amongst girls from backward communities in one go this scheme was even recognised by united nations as the best social development scheme in the developing world people dont talk enough about kanyashree  it is one of the best things to happen in bengal in my lifetimeis bengal doing great today?

social media is rife with tells of how people are being turned away from hospitals  and thats not bjp propaganda im receiving news from my friends who are doctors that theres state sponsored propaganda to hide the numbers mamata even went as far to forcefully audit the deaths to comorbid conditions so that the covid report can be suppressed funny thing is  unless theres comorbid conditions  youll not even die from covid  that doesnt mean its not spreading4 industrial output  pray tell what mamata has done to improve the states industrial output? where are the jobs? weve all been hearing the empty lies from the biswa bangla summit  how many of the those projects ever came to fruition?5 minority appeasement  while modi is trying to get rid of muslims  mamata is doing the opposite  going as far as to ignore the criminal elements in the society to pander to that votebank the attack on doctors that sparked a protest across the country was fueled by the simple fact that mamata didnt have the guts to arrest the criminals because they were muslims  even when the rational bengali muslim community tried denouncing them over and over she has given the statement that those who came from bangladesh and have voted are now citizens even if they have come recently  what the fuck? mamata doesnt get to decide who gets citizenship we dont want bangladeshis here  no matter if they are hindu or muslim her government had even shielded war crime convicts just to get some brownie points why?theres no difference between modi and mamata except the fact that while the first one is trying to get rid of the muslims  the second one was trying to alleviate them to a godlike status  one imam from a bengali masjid gave the statement a few years ago that the muslims will decide who gets to become the cm of wb  other than that  the lies and jumla are just as widespread  the corruption just as deep the only reason mamata gets away with all this is because bengal has became irrelevant in the national stage no one gives a shit else shes just as corrupt and authoritarian as modi and if talking about the developments  these are all being done with a single strategy destroy bengals industrial output  evict all the educated folks  so whoever left becomes solely dependant on the state for their livelihood meanwhile she and her goons can continue ruling the state like the left has done for last 3 decades thats all there is to itbengalis have no hope left its tmc or bjp  and both are cancerous in their own ways only chance is for an arvind kejriwal to rise  but thats probably never gonna happen most educated and literate bengalis are leaving the state  whos gonna rise to the occasion? there should be a trade off between socialism and capitalismsomething in between so everyone can benefit  deleted  nice writeup bro hows the popularity of bjp among bengalis ? i heard they are gaining ground in some spots and local polls  do you think communists supporting the bjp will affect tmc much ? okey lets list pros and cons of mamata and tmcpros 1  mamata is authoritarian but still tmc regime is way more free than the previous cpm rule it was possible to openly post against tmc in social media such open criticism of the government or party was impossible for most people earlier2  rural infrastructure is developed a lot in comparison to previous regime roads are improved a lot3  the police and the government offices are more active4  smaller crimes like eve teasing and theft are reduced in my experience5  the government and the party is secular and not racist  at all which is a big plus point in todays india6  economy of the state is improved7  government officials and police has more power than the previous regime where they were puppets of the local party officecons 1  one woman party and government due to her tendency to control everything her government is full with people who are good for nothing and totally useless she doesnt like people who would argue with her2  her intolerance against opposition3  tmc is full with goons and politicians whose sole aim is to make money by hook or crook4  appeasement of big groups of people for vote yes  not only muslims  she tried to appease every groups who are united enough the all india media do not show her appeasement of hindu matua people who are a big votebank she tried to appease both mullahs and brahmin pandits by offering them money she also gave money to clubs and durga pujas5  various scams like sharada  trifala etc6  state government employees are angry with her due to  not giving da and other allowances at par with the central7  reduction of government employments and some questionable recruitmentsverdicttmc is still better than bengal bjp which is openly anti muslim  anti science  anti intellectual pro fake news and anti bengali good write up  mogambo khush huya  removed ,2020-04-19 22:52:34
Policy/Economy, policy  creating jobs in the indian economy,161,66u52j,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/66u52j/policy_creating_jobs_in_the_indian_economy/,82,an askindia thread asked the same question i replied without reading this persons entire post  which turned out to be trolling so im reposting my comment here it starts with some historical background  and ends with a comparative description of how other countries have performedmy answer clothes and shoes1 industrialization historically  models of industrialisation have followed two pathways  slow but steady where western advanced economies like the usa  uk undertook economic development in tandem with political development they did not begin with universal franchise this helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak  accelerated growth economic successes mostly in east asia began authoritarian  explicitly  korea  china  or de facto  singapore  thailand  taiwan   and gave way to political transformation only after a degree of economic success was achieved2 where does india stand india has attempted economic development while also granting universal franchise from the very beginning the only other countries in this group are botswana  mauritius  jamaica  trinidad and tobago  and costa rica  all perennial democracies at independence  india was one of the poorest nations  regardless of political system  with a per capita gdp of just 617  ppp  this implies  the indian state has been ever burdened by the demands for redistribution since early in its life  leading to the poor state capacity we see today  healthcare  education  law enforcement   there is a distrust of the private sector and overreliance on public capacity  exit  that is  winding down  declaring bankruptcy  and plugging inefficiencies is hard because of diverse stakeholders  vested interests  and poor institutions3 what kind of jobs does india need  india needs to generate jobs that are formal and productive  provide bangforbuck in terms of jobs created relative to investment  have the potential for broader social transformation  and can generate exports and growth apparel and footwear sectors fit this bill4 how have apparel and footwear worked for the east asian economies? in the successful east asian economies  countries where gdp growth booms averaged between 710 per cent  growth in the exports of these two sectors was exceptional for comparison  over a 20 year period postliberalisation for each economy  country year of takeoff annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off  per cent  of apparel annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off  per cent  of leather and footwear annual avg economic growth for 20 years post take off  per cent       korea 1962 304 699 90 bgl 1985 279 298 52 thailand 1960 538 441 75 indonesia 1967 658 486 70 malaysia 1970 334 275 69 china 1978 186 277 98 vietnam 1985 178 161 66 india 1980 127 54 56 5 why has india underperformed? for a lot of historical  religious  and sociocultural reasons however  those pertinent to contemporary times include  logistics costs and time for getting goods from factorytoport are greater furthermore  indian ports are unequipped to handle very large capacity containers we use sri lankan ports for such transshipments  labor regulations labor costs are low  but regulations strangulate formalization because of high overtime pay requirements  de facto epf contribution taxes for lowpaid workers  and inflexible firing policies  tax and tariff policies indias domestic tax policies and unbalanced in that they promote cottonbased fibres instead of manmade fibres  which is the bulk of the global demand similarly  the global demand is for nonleather footwear  while indias share of global exports in leather footwear are double that of nonleather footwear  ie it wrongly focuses on leather footwear   export market discrimination eu and us impose customs tariffs on indian apparel and footwear exports at 10  while it is 0 for bangladesh so indian firms shift operations outside of indiawhat should india do?   what is it doing? ill add in this later if i see this post getting enough traction writing all of this took a lot of time in and of itself if you have any suggestions  write away in the comments,ringtring, theres a great recent episode on rajya sabha tvs state of the economy where they discuss employment in india its just 24 minutes skip the first 2 minutes of intro  and really goes into depth  yet in an accessible way https  youtube qaubzqnpov4?t2m53s since east asia was mentioned bit offtopic but can someone eli5 how japan became such a developed country after us completely fucked them over with the tokyo

startup  small business innovation initiative  ssbi  strategy 6 create a technology platform that enables startup and sme growth  some really interesting contributions here already there is one crucial sector we might be overlooking though  public sector jobs  especially police  judiciary and healthcare workers this is important  firstly  because most of our public services are so understaffed there is massive log jamming in the judiciary for instance  scant police coverage in most areas  absolute lack of healthcare facilities in a large part of the country an efficient economy can only be built in the foundation of a well functioning polity a healthier  safer society is an absolute necessity for a healthy economy secondly  having more public sector jobs ends up creating more private jobs  especially in the service economy the problem we run into when speaking of public sector is jobs is financing this is a big problem i believe fully staffing our public services is an investment we dont question the need for physical infrastructure  we shouldnt for well staffed public services also  its high time we did something about the shameful legacy of the past  housing our netas in palatial bungalows  the most expensive real estate in the country sell of lutyens delhi babu bungalows  create a fund  invest in human capital  this should be a sticky post economic survey this year had a separate chapter on clothes and shoes  you should read that eu resident here most of the top quality branded clothes  hoodies  tshirts and jeans  we wear here and houseries  including ikea  are actually made in bangladeshif anyone can supply these products with same quality and similar price  i can create a few jobs in india good start admins should close the other troll genocide thread ill try to divide my reply in two parts the first where i reply to some of your points and the second where ill try to write up some new parts which you didnt touch on__________________________________________________________first part slow but steady western economies accelerated growth east asiathis is actually somewhat inaccurate as dani rodrik and many others have pointed out  there has only been one single path to prosperity for large economies which cant rely on fossil fuels or on tourism like trinidad and tobago  thats the path of exportled manufacturing growth most people mistakenly think this is the east asian model but this was how the uk  germany and france all developed same is true with the us manufacturing was a huge part of the us economy up until perhaps the 1970s some people claim india cant replicate this model for two reasons the first is automation ai  which limits employment opportunity the second is slow trade protectionism ill be brief on bothas far as ai automation is concerned  a lot of people have to understand that plenty of jobs that were counted as manufacturing in the past were actually service sector jobs its just that they were in the factory back in the old days today everything is hyperspecialised  so a lot of those jobs have moved out but are socalled auxiliary services they dont get counted with manufacturing today  but they should if they were  job losses arent nearly as bad as its made out to beas for trade protectionism is concerned  its true that the world economy is growing slower than during the boom times  but historical perspective is needed the average growth during the 1990s was slower than what the world economy is growing at right now korea  taiwan and the other asian tigers as well as ireland and some eastern european nations poland  slovakia etc  had very rapid growth during this period  despite generally low global growth so  i think this excuse doesnt really hold today yes  the opportunities are lower than in the 2000s  but from a historical perspective they are slightly above average  sadly our focus has been on cotton and yarn exports at best fabrics and some niches like home textiles we havent been able to crack the apparels segmentour largest textile companies  measured in terms of investment or market cap  are yarn companies or home fabrics companies in footwear we could have an edge in leather footwear  but this beef ban thing could be a detterant   u ringtring your original post is good but i would like to point that thailand  bgl bangladesh?   malaysia and indonesia are not under east asia but under asean few points   where western advanced economies like the usa  uk undertook economic development in tandem with political development they did not begin with universal franchise semantic use of the term in tandem is not accurate enough plus the timelines are so broad they are meaningless  using such broad terms one can even say that south korea developed under this slow western model because it changed its system before it had become developed  the fact is the political development is a spectrum in itself and the west like us esp was on the end of this spectrum closer to everyone else who developed than on the other end of it  where basically no one exists  meaning  no one has ever developed under a democracy and since democracies are of various types we need to provide context for it and that context was provided things like universal suffrage is a basic and easy metric india is an older proper democracy than us in this manner   other can be used as well like the power holdings among a few rich homogeneous elites even despite the voting rights  as for the point on why india has underperformed  the fundamental reasons are that india has not followed the general path that leads to development there is no universal model for it but there are certain practices which are nearuniversal meaning they are de facto prerequisite requirements  things like having an infrastructure in place before you set up a secondary and tertiary sector like services and rd  this a a dynamic which goes even beyond industrialization there is no development and stability without infra development roads were the first things a new empire build  then at the same time as this is land reforms  its another prerequisite there are plenty of evidence for this with countries that developed in the 20th century  everything else comes afterwards india is accumulating factors which are exceptional  things like democracy from the get go  tertiary sector before infrastructure land reform not even done barring few places like kerala  its no wonder things wouldnt be smooth sailing and about what india needs  i am of a different view india should help where the people are and they are in the primary sector  they are farmers that is where the labor force is help them and you solve multiple problems problems like lack of jobs if everyone over the coming generations is supposed to enter the job pool problems like not enough capital for other major works which will become obsolete  exclusive factories are not a sound long term gambit  problems like uprooting people in a country like india which is unique in terms of its diversity and already having massive population density issues  helping the people in the agriculture sector is the biggest bang for the buck it helps bring the hdi levels up  it helps the social security dynamic it helps in the balanced development of all majority people argument   currently though there is no proper model for it and this is where my views are different than most india is already doing things in its own way it is already the exception it should look for new models of growth instead of relying on preexiting ones which may or may not really be that effective at the stage india is in no model is universal  they have to be fitted to the place they are being implemented in india should look for solutions which are novel and unique to its situation   currently though india seems to have picked the same model of growth that has been used by majority of the world and that is rapid growth through fast tracked urbanization 10 years back indian urbanization rate was less than 20  now its reaching mid 30s  to me this goes against the india ethos and even practically its not sound for india given its unique spread of population over a smaller area and stressed natural resources   when koreans chinese started to make toys to be sold in the west  they never knew they would become some one like this indian ways of growing is not faulty  it can be considered as a new way we have a lot problems which most previous governments ignored and china korea us gave a lot of importance during early industrializationindustrialization needs infrastructure  skilled worker and rule of law which are missing in india we have a pathetic infrastructure because the government doesnt want to anger people and politicians have a huge interest in infrastructure building  we could not build everything very quickly roads bridges ports railways are very slow and inefficient most people will not leave land easily the environment must be protected the contractors also make a lot of money by building everything slowly and of bad quality rural education is in a very bad condition most factory workers  construction crew usually come from rural areas in india  most of them are very unskilled and difficult to be trained inefficient governance is also another reason our state is very backward it takes days for people to get the documents and months for companies bureaucrats usually dont work for people unless someone attacks them law enforcement is also very bad  this post and the discussion that it brought fold is gold ive been through the entire thread and this is some real quality discussion thanks to everyone who contributed to the discussion  reading it has been a pleasure its disheartening that the comments dont have as many points and the ones in the political threads do  one area prime for reforms and job creation i feel is agriculture i think india is employing a huge proportion of its population in farming and yet its very inefficient  maybe the latter is the cause for former i think agriculture can be leveraged to bring jobs to rural areas bu investing in rural infrastructure creation  warehouses and storage  distribution and transportation and food processing this coupled with building human resource capital in rural and semiurban areas be it teachers public transportation workers  support personnels etc manufacturing should be our main focus and we should focus on both domestic oriented and export oriented manufacturing    where western advanced economies like the usa  uk undertook economic development in tandem with political development they did not begin with universal franchise this helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weakas far as uk is concerned  what period was the capacity weak  when did it become strong? i dont think india has an  unemployment problem it just has people who dont want to work  ,2017-04-22 17:49:09

dude imagine its just the first year of his second term  and so much has happened 4 years are still remaining im scared as fuck stop crying for daddy  we wanted a suppository from decisive leader modi and he has been giving us doses like demo  gst  balakot caa and now this you will take this diblopment and keep voting for him or the next cattle bothered in 2024 while crying about how there is no other choice fuck you go back to whatsapp rode the wave my ass you knew this was coming and believe me  you will be voting for modi again in 2024 sorry  brother modi has just about started with you and shah is still lubing up yogi and others are in line too you dont get to leave now till you get your votes worth enjoy i think rahul gandhi is stupid so i will vote for a party of murdering bigotssome of yall really dont have a sense of depth manmohan singh is 87 years old if i were in his place  i would have shown middle finger to indians and gone to some foreign country we dont deserve him you made it happen everyone knew it  bjp would enable this eventually still  people like you vote for him but  good on you that you realized we didnt know this was going to happen?sorry  ignorant morons like you are the ones who enabled all of this to happen in the first place you voted for development and casually chose to ignore incidents like 2002 and now youre ranting about this? good luck its dr manmohan singh  not mr  are you from the same constituency as narendra ? since you want a logical answer here it goes india is a massive country which makes slow and steady progress we move slowly and that is because we have a lot of inertia but once we start moving  it is difficult to stop us we didnt move our asses for close to 2 centuries to send off the brits  but once we got together  it didnt take too long this characteristic of ours carries on and is seen in our parliament bills take too long to go through and there is opposition from every group  logical because everyone has their own perspective  but once the discussions are done  implementation becomes easy and this tardiness is hated by our generation we need things to move fast and lack patience so when we saw upa going slow with the bills and everything  the hope of a strong leader who can hasten things was sold to people and we lapped it up however  we forgot that indian politics runs on fake promises we were given images of gujarats development  but few even bothered to check whether modi was the guy who did it  fun fact he wasnt  thus  our newfound hope  modi become the pm who would deliver us unto the new india nobody paid attention to the 2002 riots or maybe they thought he would have learnt from his mistakes but lest we forget  it is the rss that holds the reins now i am okay with you if you voted for him in 2014 if you did vote for him in 2019  you better get off your arse and protest like there is no tomorrow for you fell for the rhetoric of patriotismedit congress can do whatever the fuck they want  like sticking with pappu  similarly  you can do whatever the fuck you want you can go protest or spread the truth about this government or work for the development of the society the choice is yours even an ape is better than modi as the pm as long it doesnt make the citizens kill each other how about shashi tharoor? rahul gandhi is not a retard narendra modis problem is not that he is a narcissist his problem is that he is a terrorist anyone is better that modi especially rahul he would actually listen to others such as mms people who voted for modi for the second time are the worst i would give the first time a pass because he was promising development the second time only thing he promised was this and thats why they are the worst they knew what he stood for they knew how crooked and dumb he was rafale  demo etc all happened the first term they only way these people could get worse is saying stuff like rahul is bad you guys choose modi after you knew what he did and what he was capable of everybody knew this was going to happen especially in 2019 everybody knows what the rss is everyone knew about the 2002 riots and everyone knew all the bs about rahul  was just pr and you believed all that and still do his quote history will be kinder to me than the contemporary media and the opposition parties in parliament has never been so damn true lets be realistic he is very old there are many talented people in congress too i sincerely hope tharoors rebel against gandhi family succeed not that rahul gandhi is all bad but bjp has made his such image so that it is very unlikely for public to support him over few years he should accept it and keep low profile for few years voting for modi in 2014 is forgivable but not in 2019 if you voted in 2014  then you should be fine koi lautaa de mere beete hue din  btw manmohan singhs term was the highest on corruption there were new scandals every day i dont know which one was worsecongress let all their minister loot the whole country now they victimblame all the time they could have done something good  but they didnt they are the reason for their demise,2020-02-26 16:12:06

2016_indian_banknote_demonetisation  a couple more points id like to add just because 993 of the cash in circulation prior to demo has returned to the system doesnt mean that the excercise was a complete failure the issue of black money was tackled on several fronts i believe the main point of demo was never to take out a significant chunk of currency out of rotation  despite what the government says  i believe the government got everyone on the blackmoney bandwagon as a way to make people feel that they personally were helping in the fight against black money again  just my theory i believe the true purpose of demo was to bring more transparency and accountability to the economic system  in addition to making more and more of india tax compliant and a part of the formal economy i do believe that the informal sector plays a very important role  particularly in the times of economic crisis  but thats a story for another daysumming up  id like to point out that demo can neither be categorized as a success or a failure it has its place  in the grey  neither black nor white as some people believe thats the point of my post thanks for readingplease let me know if i missed anything and id be happy to update my post,facts_and_figures, i do not agree with your summation as a small business owner myself  my overall takeaway is that it was pretty detrimental for the growth for many of us earlier i was supportive of a move to eliminate black money but i saw my own income drop by 70 as well as many of my friends startups failing or forcing enterpreneurs to get jobs instead of trying to pursue their ideas instead of getting tax rebates and incentives  if small business provide jobs  we were burdened with thr complicated process of gst and huge fall of demand from the mediumpaying client tldrlife is so cheap in india and op has no issues with that  i believe the true purpose of demo was to bring more transparency and accountability to the economic systemcan we please have this transparency and accountability in all aspects of governance? or is that too much to askanyway its enlightening to look at this discussion  please carry on the financial perspectives  sorry about the digressionedit this thread was submitted 12 hours ago? come on fellas  this thread needs several upvotes after long last we are seeing a topic with substantial data points  we really need to debate this topic to death and there should be more inputs such as the one from  u ravivazirani not to nitpick but analysis need to go further into the ugly part also the dear leader and the

to emerge stronger and is projected to be usd 650 bn by 2025 and usd 1 000 bn by 2030 residential  commercial and retail are the three key asset classes  which have primarily been contributing to the sectors growth real estate contributed nearly 6 to indias gdp in 2017 as per the projected growth trends  the sectors contribution is likely to rise to 13 of indias gdp by 2025 real estate  largest

of 985 over the past five years this credible performance was achieved  together with low volatility relative to equities and bonds  for highly competitive riskadjustment returns  attractive and stable income return  specially in commercial space  the rental yield from real estate is much higher than returns on any traditional sources of investment commercial investment can yield upto 12 roi and lowest to 5 roi  with capital appreciation  depending upon the construction stage and lease terms of the property inflation hedging the inflation hedging capability of real estate stems from the positive relationship between gdp growth and demand for real estate as economies expand  the demand for real estate derives rents higher and this  in turn  translates into higher capital values long term assured wealth building asset with predictable  returns and least risk  real estate helps you build wealth in long term due to dual advantage of regular predictable returns  yield is higher than dividend returns  and an assured capital appreciation in long term  dont be scared of corporate scams  while they can affect the companys stock price or your banks health  but it cannot junk out the

largest test of homeworking in history and corporates are adopting  refining and testing policies  processes and infrastructure to make it work we expect quarantine protocols to encourage workfromhome

indeed creditworthy these are expected to yield fruitful results in the future and help establish indian real estate as a preferred destination for global investors  occupiers  and homebuyerswhy real estate during lockdown?probably most of the people interested in buying real estate would be holding their decision till the lock down opens due to speculations in the market or risk pertaining to economic conditions yet for any clever investor who is observing the current market will testify buying of real estate during lock down to be the smartest move here is why 1 reduction in home loan rates on 27 march 2020  the reserve bank of india  rbi  reduced the repo rate by 75 basis points  bps  the reduction saw the repo rate reduce from 515 to 440 new home loan rates start at 8 from 1 march 2020 so indeed this is good time to buy your home if the decision was just hiding behind the corner for some better rates or good units2 low demand  value for money real estate is facing deficit demand in the market which leads to generation of various attractive offers by developers to maintain the good books  builders are currently offering very low rates  lucrative payment plans and additional offers resulting in lowering the cost of property enduser can expect to buy a property as low as the launch price during this lock down3 reduction in stamp duty the maharashtra government on march 6 announced that it is reducing stamp duty on properties by 1 for mumbai  mmrda region and pune for a period of two years4 passive income various small investment options are being introduced in the market starting as low as 5 lacs in real estate that too with a rental income this is again an opportunity to create a separate asset class in your portfolio and start a source of passive income5 demand supply breakthrough due to low demand  discounted rates on good inventories are available but once the economic condition will start settling  the bargain will reduce and demand will also start floating upwards the rates will not be as low as they are now during lock down6 segment shift  earlier lower middle class people used to buy 10 to 12 lakh property now middle class will buy those as an investor and rent it out to lower middle income group similarly shift will take place on affordable segment likewise middle income group will emerge as new investor community7 strike the iron when it is hot we all must have heard this at least once but its time to implement the strategy to gain extensive returns on the investment not only the rates are strikingly low  the return on investment that are being offered by some developers is as high as 1518final thoughts your money is safe in indian real estate regulator like maharera leading the cause of timely justice   high court judiciary being extremely proactive and proconsumer   investor   nclt giving prompt hearings and orders favoring customer and financial institution and lastly  the supreme court judgment reaffirms the rights of the homebuyers as financial creditors under the bankruptcy code simply put  it means that homebuyers share equal rights of recovery in the developers assets which are liquidated as part of the bankruptcy processthe bottom linereal estate cannot be lost or stolen  nor can it be carried away  purchased with common sense  paid in full  and managed with reasonable care   it is about the safest investment in the worldreal estate is a distinct asset class that is simple to understand and can enhance the risk and return profile of an investors portfolio on its own  real estate offers competitive riskadjusted returns  with less principalagent conflict and attractive income streams though illliquidity can be a concern for some investors  there are ways to gain exposure to real estate yet reduce illliquidity and even bring it onpar with that of traditional asset classes real estate investing even on a small scale  remains a tried and true means of building an individuals cash flow and wealthbuy real estate in areas where the path exists   and buy more real estate where there is no path  but you can create your own dont wait to buy real estate   buy real estate and

okay cigarettes are 45 a piece here cant afford groceries if the lockdown goes on for another month sure  suggest us to buy cheap properties fucking real estate assholes to a hammer every problem looks like it can be fixed by a nail fact of the matter is real estate is a bad investment in india you may buy a house if you wish to live in it however as an investment vehicle with pitiful rental yields of 23 due to over supply in most cities  it is a renters marketbuying land on the outskirts where the city will grow into is a much better investment compared to buying built real estate real estate shoule be the last thing one should be investing in   in the next 1215 months1 rental yields from a rented home would barely be enough to cover the emi of a housing loan   let alone act as a secondary source of income   im2 houses are highly illiquid investments with the kind of job losses predicted over the next 1215 months   one needs or have a solid savings pool to be easily accessible if there are no takers for your house   you will have virtually no  liquidity on hand to provide for emergency expenditures   mom and dad falling ill  deferred jobs for your sons and daughters   layoffs for you etc   3 post corona   the reverse migration that has happened will not see most migrants returning any time soon most villages are self sufficient and labor migrates for better opportunities to cities there will be  scant opportunities  post corona recovery and labour shortages will not be accompanied by commensurate wage increase as real estate firms will not be able to afford higher project outflows for labour so expect massive delays on projects that are under construction  a large number of real estate firms will wind up quite a few will be stuck in litigation  you money may be stuck and you may never even see an asset we are going through a highly irregular time this is not a good time for such stupid investment decisions psa  stay away from this wall of

Policy/Economy,indian govt banning investment from china is yet another masterstroke by modi  this time  to kill startups,0,g4s5yd,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g4s5yd/indian_govt_banning_investment_from_china_is_yet/,13,modi is on a killing spree after killing poor people in demo  msme in gst  now his latest target is startups indian startups are among the most innovative companies in the world  and have recorded huge growth despite negligible assistance from the modi government with economy already slowing down before covid impact  and now in a state of paralysis  several promising startups will go under water  unless they receive investments china is a key investor in several prominent indian startups that lot of indians use  from paytm to zomato  byjus  makemytrip  swiggy ola  big basket etc though chinese holding companies like alibaba  tencent etc  chinese firms have invested over 4 billion into indian startups  https  timesofindiaindiatimescom business indiabusiness with4billionchineseinvestmentdesistartupswaryoffdipolicytweak articleshow 75228027cms  many such startups rely on chinese funding and now will find it harder to access investments investments from us companies into indian startups have already been slowing down  and during the global pandemic any source of investment that can keep promising companies from failing should be welcome instead the govt thinks otherwise after china picked up additional 02 stake in hdfc  indian govt reacted swiftly  without thought  by banning regular investments from countries that india shares a border with china has already slammed this move  as it is against world trade organisations free trade practices  india could be exposed to sanctions with an already failing economy  this can deepen the crisis  leave several startups out of money and lots of people who work in the startup space without jobs and livelihood key question to ask are1 why did mere 02 additional investment in hdfc trigger the govt so much? owning 11 of hdfc gets china no say in any matter related to hdfc yet china owns huge  of indian startups and thus can exert control on these companies  as well as access data of indians 2 what kind of thought was put into this decision? its clear that finance ministry doesnt put much thought into most of its policies  as evidenced by the downward spiral of economy and key finance ministry portfolio holders more interested in goli maro than economy  but is killing startups during an already fast growing global pandemic crisis really required? 3 what kind of relief will india provide to its startups? indian govt coffers are already running on fumes just to deal with coronavirus disaster  billions of dollars would have to be spent by the govt that will leave little room for other reliefs infact the only way govt can survive is by taxing already tax payers even further in this situation  is indian govt equipped to provide any relief to startups?many indians have been celebrating the news of banning chinese investments as if this is good news for the country no it is not it is stupid  unplanned and achieves no real purpose huge indian listed companies like hdfc cannot be taken over by china so easily  while china already has lot of control on indian startups  due to existing investments govt could have smartly brought about antitakeover laws instead of outright banning all chinese investments instead this govt has shown its foolishness again  and with scant thought has enacted a rule that will spray gasoline on an already burning economy without any thought  the ban button has been pressed yet again the same ban button that has become modis favourite  for all situations,ShortTesla_Rekt5, china is a snake dressed as a puppy best blocked look how the ccp is protesting now saying that indias protections violate the wto rules where were the wto rules when lakhs of crores worth of state sponsorship was given to ccp companies to dump products everywhere at prices lower than the raw material costs  simply to kill the domestic manufacturers? you cannot even get a diwali lamp thats made in india these days  and it is because local makers cannot compete with the state subsidized manufacturing and dumping by china honestly  if a startup is really good  money will flow in from everywhere companies like paytm are not real innovations they are data mining operations great startups have marquee investors from us  singapore  korea etc we dont need china they have taken over companies all across eu and australia they sneak in  then buy it completely  paytm to zomato  byjus  makemytrip  swiggy ola  big basket these companies are hardly innovative and just do the middleman business but online too much vc money is not good for whole business ecosystem these companies are subsidizing to create mono duopoly  and crushing down the other competing domestic startups we dont want that  why did mere 02 additional investment in hdfc trigger the govt so much? hdfc is a  systemically important bank  https  enwikipediaorg wiki systemically_important_financial_institution  in short  a bank  insurance company  or other financial institution whose failure might trigger a financial crisis they are colloquially referred to as too big to fail owning every  of hdfc is like owning a part of indian economy  so obviously indian govt will loose their shit if china invest more in this company  indian startups are among the most innovative companies in the world  and have recorded huge growth despite negligible assistance from the modi governmentdude  what the hell are you smoking? indian startups are mere copycats of western businesses flipkart copied amazon  ola copied uber  oyo copied airbnb  paytm copied paypal  zomato copied yelp  the list goes on 1 why did mere 02 additional investment in hdfc trigger the govt so much? owning 11 of hdfc gets china no say in any matter related to hdfchdfc ltd is a lending company with deep ties to the banking sector even a 1 stake lets them get into the board  and they get veto powers a ccpowned firm having veto powers in one of the largest banking organizations of the country? no  thanks 2 what kind of thought was put into this decision? its clear that finance ministry doesnt put much thought into most of its policies  as evidenced by the downward spiral of economy and key finance ministry portfolio holders more interested in goli maro than economy  but is killing startups during an already fast growing global pandemic crisis really required?while i agree that the finance ministry is daft in regards to various policy matters since it is controlled by the pmo  a veto against china wont kill startups what kills startups are their lack of revenue management almost all startups are running in losses how long will financers back these companies? businesses exist to generate profit  yet most modern startups dont have those plans in sight  both indian and foreign startups as well  3 what kind of relief will india provide to its startups? indian govt coffers are already running on fumes just to deal with coronavirus disaster  billions of dollars would have to be spent by the govt that will leave little room for other reliefs infact the only way govt can survive is by taxing already tax payers even further in this situation  is indian govt equipped to provide any relief to startups?why should government systems provide financial aid to companies  both startups as well as established businesses? that whole line of thinking is wrong in my opinion unfortunately  the worst precedent was set when government bailed out banks during the 2008 financial crisis yes  businesses have been hurt by covid19  and a lot of them have incurred losses as well isnt it part of running a busines? if startups dont learn to not put all their eggs in one basket  the government cannot help it the most a government can do  and i am not talking bjp   congress here  is relax taxation and bureaucratic mess of paperwork to ease startups to get back to their feet i dont think india has banned investments they just made it mandatory to seek government approval before its doneif china is pissed they can take it up theirsyou just need to look at australia  if you want to see what giving china free rein could mean in a tough situation what are the anti takeover laws you are talking about? do you have an example of any country implementing it successfully? not in a harsh tone  just curious i do not understand why everyone thinks they are financial experts and the people running the country with advisors who are some of the best experts in their fields are all idiotsas for answering your question  you have to think bigger and broader than just startups  as an effect of coronavirus there is going to be a recession and most industries would be going into red  so as to avoid hostile takeovers and keep the industries safe the decision was takenyou should open your mentality a little broader and read about what china has done in maldives and how much debt maldives is in right now you can also google about what china is doing in africainstead of appreciating when the country actually takes steps to protect its national interests and assets here you are deriding it and favouring china i am truly speechless you are not a financial expert  your post shows that  + will advise to read a bit about indias diplomatic relations and how international trade works + listen to experts views on the same  varied views   now you can form a opinion  if you want to  where did you get your degree in economics?,2020-04-21 02:18:54

hindus,140,f15kgm,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f15kgm/opinion_bjps_policies_have_alienated_a_large/,55,one of indias election commissioners  ashok lavasa  in a brilliant  recent   https  indianexpresscom article opinion columns thedifficultyofbeinghonestpreventionofcorruptionactashoklavasaelectioncommissionofindia6188078  article  wrote people are generally good  they are also generally timid and i think it defines our middle classes perfectlyindia has always had an aspirational middle class this middle class is largely moderate  driven by ambitions of economic prosperity and social stability  just like the middle classes of any other country  they want to be socially and economically upwardly mobile  resent overtly divisive policies with uncertain ends and are busy in their lives  thus the timidity now  the point of a democratic society is democratic changes  aka gradual changes  theres a reason were regarded as elephants and chinas as a dragon we praise china for what theyve done with their economy but hold dear what we have ie our voicemodi govt seems to be constantly stirring the pot with radical policies this has started affecting the lives of a common indian more than ever  and negatively too modi supporter or not  demonetisation  for example  in hindsight  is uniformly chided for being wasteful and avoidablemiddle and lower middle classes will now increasingly start disassociating with what this govt stands for the caa crackdown  kashmir situation but most importantly the incompetent handling of the economy will soon have them looking for viable alternatives a bjp  which for the longest time stood for economic liberalisation  corruptionfree politics  efficient governance  atleast in the minds of the educated  now stands exposed with its vitriolic campaigns and its ineptitude to handle nuanced issues like the kashmir problem i see a political vacuum forming soon  and a desperate search for alternatives by the upwardly mobile middle and lower middle classes and an opportunity for something new,Sulh-i-kul,  a bjp  which for the longest time stood for economic liberalisation  corruptionfree politics  efficient governance  atleast in the minds of the educated  now stands exposed with its vitriolic campaigns and its ineptitude to handle nuanced issues like the kashmir problem anybody whos followed the history of the bjp has always been aware that the bjp stands for none of what youve mentioned hate and vitriol have always been their identity  backed by protectionism  corruption  and incompetence they were pretty smart in messaging during 2013 and 2014 with promises for jobs and economic growth now their ineptitude has been exposed and they veil has come off no wonder this isnt what people voted for progressive  liberal in the office onsite jobs internet school college   archaic and conservative at home  this is the average middle class household  being educated doesnt help indias middle class is very conservative and believes in bigotry i dont think think they are even close to being moderates perhaps not take a look at this comment on another threadhttps  wwwredditcom r india comments f14822 delhiites_dont_care_for_article_370_for_ram fh24qwv  i talked to a friend who had worked for a bjp think tank  he told me bjp people arent stupid  they polarize because his think tank and other companies have literally done data analytics stuff to show it works they submit reports subtly suggesting keeping these policies running in nice white binders professionally typed out in english and with impeccable grammar to amit shah  fadnavis  modi  everyone its literally cause and effect these guys are calculative thinkers  they dont care about religion and cow either  whatever makes them rich and keeps their friends happy if the majority somehow starts becoming atheist overnight  bjp will literally start singing about eliminating religion tomorrow i honestly want to blame the people for being so fucking dumb in the first placeby  u platinumgus18there are several votebanks in operation for bjp there is the core rss votebank  the modi votebank  the development votebank  a newly minted sc st obc votebank and so on the development votebank is fast disappearing  true and probably turning into an anti modi votebank but the rest are new  believers in what modi has been doing since 2014 and they remain steadfastend of the day  the total anti bjp voter share in india is higher than bjps vote share  all put together but there is no one to bring those votes all across india against bjp there is no leadership  no unity  no clear strategy i like your optimism the fundamental truth that i have learned about indian politics is that it is dependent not on ideology  policy or party allegiance but largely on cult of personality we have had people like bal thackeray who was never elected to any position but controlled the politics of one of the largest states and one of the most important cities of the country for decades gandhis   jaya lalitha  msg  mamta banerjee the list goes on and on modi has created a cult of personality for himself that even opposition candidates are fearful of attacking him directly  rather than trading barbs with amit shah or bjp mlas  until an opposition party with cross national muscle has a leadership figure who can cultivate a cult of personality around himself to oppose modi  there will be no real power vacuum at the national levelcongress is dead behind rahul gandhi  no other opposition party has a nationally relevant figure future i could see is with aap kejriwal who has moulded himself into the archetype of middleclass indian man  but aap have years if not decades of work ahead of them to build a national party rather than a regional one lauda kuch nahi hone wala this country is full of chutiyas bjp will win again at the national level because congress has shat the bed i so hope somehow kejriwal sir does well in delhi again in the next 4 years and he can form a good opposition to the nazi sanghi squad middle class in india is tiny percentage of population bjp knows they can take them for granted they had this great opportunity after revoking 370  win the confidence of people there  bring stability instead they installed a dick of a governer who is bullshitting and their ministers from other states giving statements that they will go and buy lands therecaa is still debatable by nrc is throwing at the fan above youyou cannot hide incompetence behind the garb of good intentions lol middle class hindus

not just delhi  in any place india has minimum wage? it is a good step although many unskilled workers work is not documented and is paid whatever the employer feels like one would agree to work on currently  in nct delhi daily wage worker  contract based  dihadi majdoor   construction labors are paid around 300 rs  day for 10 hrs of work so not much is changed however what has been done is commendable curious  how much merit is there to concerns of labour intensive businesses migrating to other states? this sounds good on paper but it is a good step if and only if the government has factored in whether the business industry can afford the additional cost this is why it is important to talk to the industry too otherwise  the industries will just move their factories to other states causing a huge job loss in delhi and the businesses who remain will be forced to increase their price to be in business making everything for the consumers in delhi costlier this will probably end up as a costly learning experience to the inexperienced aap government  if you side only with the workers its communism  and if you only support the corporates its capitalism and both these models wont work in india that is why it is important to talk to both parties to understand each others problem  and then create policies that address themedit as an example of considering a lot of things when making a policy  free education for all sounds like a great idea until you factor in the reality that you then have to create jobs for all these educated people and you would also drive down the cost of labour with so many educated people seeking jobs this is why education in india  and other countries  is deliberately affordable to only a certain section of society or to the exceptional  scholarships  that is why education is only free up to the level our economy can accommodate  currently at school levels  as offered in government schools  this is why it is important to talk with every stakeholder when making a policy hopefully aap has done thisfor those interested   minimum wages for states across india  https  wwwsimpliancein minimumwages  its a good move depending on how strictly they are followed it can have direct and indirect effects on the wage curve and i think the indirect effects is what the companies are scared of  because it cost them more so they will try to find loopholes or have undocumented work done wow  i was paid 15 000 bucks for 6 days a week  8 hours a day and i had an ma in psychology depressing as fuck also  we pay our maids way less than the minimum wage in maharashtra  looks like why wont they vote for them first free travel for women in dtc now this highest in the country? i think kerala has a minimum wage of 18000   correct me if iam wrong i dont understand why this is such big news  the central minimum wage for unskilled labour in cat a centres has been 15 184 per 26 calendar days of 8 hours each with 2x for overtime since april and its expected to be revised again this monththese rates are religiously followed by central govt psus for contract labour the delhi govt is not even matching this figureedit the rates have been revised upwards since october 1  2019 comparison with some other statesmaharashtra 10411i would literally have to fire half my staff if this was ever actually enforced regulations should be made based on whats plausible and enforceable these best case regulations are fucking stupid it just encourages people to do underhanded shit now see industries shift from delhi atleast this will reduce the pollution  deleted  kejriwal and bernie sanders are so damn similarkejriwal raised it to around rs 15k per monthbernie wants to raise it to 15 per hour my only disappointment during the election was that aap didnt gain a foothold in other states in india hopefully  they can become the 2nd largest party by the next election after seeing the dismal performance from inc 14 thousand is way too much,2019-10-30 00:39:00

 a 2017 paper by michael dotsey  shigeru fujita and tom stark published by the federal reserve bank of philadelphia  however  argues that central bankers may be using the wrong economic model to frame policy the authors argue that there is no real tradeoff between inflation and unemployment  as assumed by generations of economists  as models based on the phillips curve have a poor forecasting record this should not be surprising     the stagflation of the 1970s proved quite convincingly that high unemployment and high inflation can very well coexist also  wages may not be as rigid as many economists assume  which means that they could adjust downward quite comfortably in many cases lastly  loose monetary policy  apart from ramping up inflation  often also causes structural distortions in the economy which lead to higher unemployment given such complexity in an economy  any effort to micromanage it may well be a fools errand      https  wwwthehinducom opinion oped whythephillipscurvedoesnotwork article19664341ece  https  wwwthehinducom opinion oped whythephillipscurvedoesnotwork article19664341ece  #x200b also  the issue of unemployment in india is a structural one and can not be dealt with making small changes via quarterly monetary policy committee meetings the issue lies with the fact that large amount of labour force depends on the primary sector which is worrisome as primary sector does not contribute to gdp commensurately the rbis been pretty hawkish in the past few years to control inflation except the last february meeting but i dont think they will go hard on the liquidity scenario nowcoming to the unemployment inflation relation  remember phillips curve isnt always true there were multiple instances of stagflation so rbis been hawkish on inflation? yesis that the reason for high unemployment? i dont think so,2020-04-15 01:15:22

this article is adblocker unfriendly  following is the text of the article  ______ indian economy from policy paralysis to investment paralysis  ______ prime minister narendra modi the attention to the state of the indian economy is welcome  but reducing it to a political blame game is not photo aplast week prime minister narendra modi joined the ongoing rhetorical debate on the state of the indian economy with a strong defence of his governments actions over the last three years among other things  his intervention put the spotlight on the indian economysomething long overdue  but not for the rhetorical charges that are being flung around on both sidesif indeed there is a pithy way of summarizing the state of affairs suffice to say that the countrys economy has transitioned from a state of policy paralysis  which identified the congressled united progressive alliance or upa  to one of investment paralysisboth are cause for worry but for entirely different reasons one was the outcome of a government which  for whatever reasons  went into a policy funk with disastrous consequencesthe other is the result of structural disruptionssome of which  like spiralling bad loans with banks  are a legacy of the upa regime and a few induced by policy changes  like the rollout of the goods and services tax  gst  and demonetization of high value currencies  undertaken over the last three yearsso while one arose from inaction  the other is largely a fallout of not anticipating or reacting in time to address the disruptions arising from hitting the reset button on the economyit is important to grasp this distinction alternatively  there is a risk of being overwhelmed by the rhetorical claims and counterclaims on the economy  and missing the woods for the trees as it wereas such the economy is not doing as badly as the opposition is claimingespecially with almost every agency forecasting a rebound in economic growth  albeit marginal  in subsequent quarters most importantly  macroeconomic stability has been restored on the other hand  it is certainly not performing to potentialwhich some argue is around 885as the governments spin doctors are arguingthis potential can be tapped only if the investment levels  which have dropped to worrisome lows  recover but this is easier said than done the legacy of bad debts or what arvind subramanian  chief economic adviser  describes as the twin balance sheet problem  because it affects the books of both companies and the banks who extended the loans  is not something that can be resolved overnightalongside the disruptions caused by structural policy responses like gst are causing considerable pain as the old business structures built over seven decades are replaced  rather abruptly in some cases  the new systems are not up and ready to take overindeed  execution of ideas is where this government has erred it is the fallout of this transition  which is lending hope to critics and a cause for worry to the governmentin a column published in mint last week  indira rajaraman  alluded to this phenomenon very succinctly according to her  gst has completely recast the existing risksharing mechanism  dealing a death blow to retail trade volumes the solution  like rajaraman argued  is not to backtrack on gst  as some political parties are suggesting   but instead to fix the anomaly through tweaks  one of which was accepted by the gst council on friday by putting in place quarterly filing of returns  instead of every month similarly  the governments anticorruption initiatives are forcing a transition to a more transparent transactions frameworkexactly why real estate  which thrived on unaccounted cash  is in such doldrums here too  the alternative framework has been slow to evolve and the government and other institutions like the reserve bank of india  rbi  are guilty of not pushing hard on walking the country through the required behavioural changethe economist intelligence unit in a note issued last week said as muchthe deceleration in bank credit growth to industry is partly attributable to the rbis initiatives and the bharatiya janata partys efforts to reduce corruption at higher levels of business and government however  the difficult business environment and slowmoving judicial system will make the transition to a more marketdriven financial system extremely difficult  and then added  we believe that a revival in private investment depends on the government injecting additional capital to banks balance sheets  but also on companies readjusting their business models to the new financial systemin the final analysis  it can safely be said that the attention to the economy is welcome  but reducing it to a political blame game is not and looking at a new and rapidly transforming india through a conventional lens is a bad ideathe union government  which has visibly begun its countdown to the 2019 general election as well as elections to key state assemblies like gujarat  may be tempted to hit the panic buttoneven though politically expedient  it would be very myopic in terms of the longterm health of the indian economyanil padmanabhan is executive editor of

openaccess journal emerging microbes and infections has cautioned that sarscov2  the virus causing the covid19 outbreak  is being shed through multiple routes  so testing through oral swabs alone might not be sufficient a paper by wei zhang  et al  all from the cas key laboratory of special pathogens at the wuhan institute of virology  says investigations on patients in a local hospital infected with the virus revealed the presence of sarscov2 in anal swabs and blood as well whats more  more anal swabs than oral swabs tested positive at a later stage of infection since covid19 is believed to be a disease of the respiratory tract  usually only oral swabs are used for diagnosis  and discharge is based on the oral swabs testing negative the anal positives suggested  they argued  shedding through the oral fecal route  and therefore transmission is possible as well the researchers also showed that a serology test  testing blood for antibodies  can improve detection positive rate  and thus should be used in the future as part of the research  samples  including oral swabs  anal swabs and blood were collected by wuhan pulmonary hospital two investigations were performed the paper describes  in the first investigation  samples were taken from 39 patients  7 of whom were in a severe condition in the second investigation  samples were lifted from 139 patients  whose clinical records were not available when counting all swab positives together  we found most of the positives came from oral swab  8 10  80  on day 0 however  this trend appears to change on day 5 we found more  6 8  75  anal swab positive than oral swab positive  4 8  50  the data suggested a shift from more oral positives during the early period to more anal positives during the later period the current strategy for the detection of viral rna in oral swabs used for 2019ncov diagnosis is not perfect the virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative this observation implies that a patient cannot be discharged purely based on oral swabs testing negative  and the researchers go on to make a recommendation to do serological tests to confirm the status#### about coronavirusescoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that may cause illness in animals or humans in humans  several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging

commands among the three defense services army  navy and air force beginning with an air defence command#### joint commands it is a unified command in which the resources of all the services are unified under a single commander looking at a geographical theatre meaning  a single military commander  as per the requirements  will have the resources of the army  the navy and the air force to manage a security threat functions of joint command    the commander of a joint command will have the freedom to train and equip his command    he will have the logistics of all the services at his beckoning    however  the three services will retain their independent identities as well joint command at present    there are two triservices commands at the moment    the joint command at the moment  the andaman and nicobar command  anc   is a theatre command  which is headed by the chiefs of the three services in rotation it was created in 2001 after a group of ministers had given a

resources  compared to the heads of the commands under the services now and the officer commanding will have access to the air forces fighter jets and can use them if needed through such integration and jointness  the three forces will be able to avoid duplication of resources the resources available under each service will be available to other services too the services will get to know one

Policy/Economy,indian economy from policy paralysis to investment paralysis,5,757k1h,http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/AKAmxxGeTLV5vM15E2DRcM/Indian-economy-From-policy-paralysis-to-investment-paralysi.html,1,nan,shadilal_gharjode, this article is adblocker unfriendly  following is the text of the article  ______ indian economy from policy paralysis to investment paralysis  ______ prime minister narendra modi the attention to the state of the indian economy is welcome  but reducing it to a political blame game is not photo aplast week prime minister narendra modi joined the ongoing rhetorical debate on the state of the indian economy with a strong defence of his governments actions over the last three years among other things  his intervention put the spotlight on the indian economysomething long overdue  but not for the rhetorical charges that are being flung around on both sidesif indeed there is a pithy way of summarizing the state of affairs suffice to say that the countrys economy has transitioned from a state of policy paralysis  which identified the congressled united progressive alliance or upa  to one of investment paralysisboth are cause for worry but for entirely different reasons one was the outcome of a government which  for whatever reasons  went into a policy funk with disastrous consequencesthe other is the result of structural disruptionssome of which  like spiralling bad loans with banks  are a legacy of the upa regime and a few induced by policy changes  like the rollout of the goods and services tax  gst  and demonetization of high value currencies  undertaken over the last three yearsso while one arose from inaction  the other is largely a fallout of not anticipating or reacting in time to address the disruptions arising from hitting the reset button on the economyit is important to grasp this distinction alternatively  there is a risk of being overwhelmed by the rhetorical claims and counterclaims on the economy  and missing the woods for the trees as it wereas such the economy is not doing as badly as the opposition is claimingespecially with almost every agency forecasting a rebound in economic growth  albeit marginal  in subsequent quarters most importantly  macroeconomic stability has been restored on the other hand  it is certainly not performing to potentialwhich some argue is around 885as the governments spin doctors are arguingthis potential can be tapped only if the investment levels  which have dropped to worrisome lows  recover but this is easier said than done the legacy of bad debts or what arvind subramanian  chief economic adviser  describes as the twin balance sheet problem  because it affects the books of both companies and the banks who extended the loans  is not something that can be resolved overnightalongside the disruptions caused by structural policy responses like gst are causing considerable pain as the old business structures built over seven decades are replaced  rather abruptly in some cases  the new systems are not up and ready to take overindeed  execution of ideas is where this government has erred it is the fallout of this transition  which is lending hope to critics and a cause for worry to the governmentin a column published in mint last week  indira rajaraman  alluded to this phenomenon very succinctly according to her  gst has completely recast the existing risksharing mechanism  dealing a death blow to retail trade volumes the solution  like rajaraman argued  is not to backtrack on gst  as some political parties are suggesting   but instead to fix the anomaly through tweaks  one of which was accepted by the gst council on friday by putting in place quarterly filing of returns  instead of every month similarly  the governments anticorruption initiatives are forcing a transition to a more transparent transactions frameworkexactly why real estate  which thrived on unaccounted cash  is in such doldrums here too  the alternative framework has been slow to evolve and the government and other institutions like the reserve bank of india  rbi  are guilty of not pushing hard on walking the country through the required behavioural changethe economist intelligence unit in a note issued last week said as muchthe deceleration in bank credit growth to industry is partly attributable to the rbis initiatives and the bharatiya janata partys efforts to reduce corruption at higher levels of business and government however  the difficult business environment and slowmoving judicial system will make the transition to a more marketdriven financial system extremely difficult  and then added  we believe that a revival in private investment depends on the government injecting additional capital to banks balance sheets  but also on companies readjusting their business models to the new financial systemin the final analysis  it can safely be said that the attention to the economy is welcome  but reducing it to a political blame game is not and looking at a new and rapidly transforming india through a conventional lens is a bad ideathe union government  which has visibly begun its countdown to the 2019 general election as well as elections to key state assemblies like gujarat  may be tempted to hit the panic buttoneven though politically expedient  it would be very myopic in terms of the longterm health of the indian economyanil padmanabhan is executive editor of

Policy/Economy,why is india protesting against caa and nrc? a detailed exhaustive explainer  legally ratified ,270,eekdl1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eekdl1/why_is_india_protesting_against_caa_and_nrc_a/,23,why are we protesting against the caa and nrc?index1are nrc and caa separate?2    what is caa and how can it be misused?       a  caa and why its unconstitutional         b  how can caa be misused3 what is the nrc? a  what is npr? b  how is nrc linked to npr? c  arguments against nrc      i  botched exercise in assam              ii  loopholes and inconsistencies in current laws      iii  religious inequality              iv  economic cost      v  cost of error1are nrc and caa separate?yes nrc is not a law  it is a process mandated by  the indian citizenship   registration of citizens and issue of national identity cards  rules 2003sourcebut are they connected? yessince any rules issued from time to time by the government are taken into consideration while interpreting any law in fact there is a clause in every act specifying the same  in our case  section 18 of the indian citizenship act 1955source2what is the caa  how can it be misused? a  caa and why its unconstitutionalthe core idea is to make it easier for  undocumented immigrants from afghanistan  bangladesh and pakistan to get indian citizenship the catch is that these immigrants cant be muslimsare there really persecuted minorities that would benefit from this legislation?yes  31 313 individuals to be precisethis was revealed by the government itself during a hearing by a parliamentary committee on the 2016 version of the bill the committee had asked how many people would benefit from the legislation the intelligence bureau repliedbut by specifically excluding muslims  and jews   the bill has raised justified concerns that the modi government is trying to enshrine religious discrimination into law this when article 14 of indias constitution prohibits discrimination on religious basiswhy does this act violate article 14?article 14 is equality of lawthe state shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of laws within the territory of india prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion  race  caste  sex or place of birththe opposition mps had pointed this out but amit shah insisted the exception to article 14  reasonable classification when making laws in simple words the state can discriminate between citizens on above grounds if special benefits are offered to them for eg  reservations for marginalised communitiesthis matter of whether reasonable classification is justified is why the act is being contended in the courts and will be decided later b  how can caa be misused?caa can be amended only by parliamentary procedures the government has said that the amendment was made to provide remedy to the six communities namely hindu  sikh  buddhist  jain  parsi or christian community from afghanistan  bangladesh or pakistan seeking shelter from religious persecution or fear of religious persecutionhowever  religious persecution is not cited anywhere in the caa  2019 the bare act readsprovided that any person belonging to hindu  sikh  buddhist  jain  parsi or christian community from afghanistan  bangladesh or pakistan  who entered into india on or before the 31st day of december  2014 and who has been exempted by the central government by or under clause  c  of subsection  2  of section 3 of the passport  entry into india  act  1920 or from the application of the provisions of the foreigners act  1946 or any rule or order made thereunder  shall not be treated as illegal migrant for the purposes of this act  religious persecution is actually mentioned under the rules to the amended passport  entry into india  act  1920this is very important to understand because the government can make changes to these rules anytime they want rules are basically subordinate laws that the central government can issue through a gazette notification at any time these laws do not require the approval of the parliamentthe above point will be important while explaining nrccredit3 what is the nrc?the national register of citizens  nrc  is a registry maintained by the government of india containing names  certain relevant information for identification of indian citizens the nationwide nrc is as a process already underway through the npr  which is proposed to be implemented in the 2021 census a  what is the npr?the npr is a list of usual residents of the country according to the ministry of home affairs  a usual resident of the country is one who has been residing in a local area for at least the last six months  or intends to stay in a particular location for the next six months unlike the nrc  the npr is not a citizenship enumeration drive  as it would record even a foreigner staying in a locality for more than six months it is mandatory for every usual resident of india to register in the nprthe npr will collect both demographic data and biometric data there are 15 different categories of demographic data  ranging from name and place of birth to education and occupation  that the rgi is supposed to collect in the npr for biometric data it will depend on aadhaar  for which it will seek aadhaar details of the residents this will allow the union government  for the first time  to connect their biometric details with information like the birthplace of their parentsapart from this  in a test run going on across the country  the rgi is seeking details of mobile number  aadhaar  pan card  driving licence  voter id card and passport  in case the resident is indian  it is also working to update the civil registration system of birth and death certificateseven as issues of privacy associated with aadhaar continue to be debated in the country  the npr is on a drive to collect detailed data on residents of india with the recent introduction of personal data protection bill  in which the centre exempts its agencies from some or all provisions of the proposed bill there are a lot of red flags being raised about misuse of such datasource b  how is npr linked to the nrc?the legal framework for the national population register is grounded in the citizenship act  1955 in 2003  the act was amended by the atal bihari vajpayeeled bjp government to introduce the category of an illegal migrant to implement this amendment  a set of rules were issued  the link to the rules is the same as 1 are caa and nrc different the rules read the central government shall  for the purpose of national register of indian citizens  cause to carry throughout the country a housetohouse enumeration for collection of specified particulars relating to each family and individual  residing in a local area including the citizenship statushow would these registers of citizens be created? the rules explicitly spell it out the local register of indian citizens shall contain details of persons after due verification made from the population registerwhen the local register is generated from the population register  a verification process would be carried out which would create the category of doubtful citizenship the final national register of citizens would be prepared by asking doubtful citizens to prove they are indians as part of a claims and objections processthis population register mentioned in the rules is nothing other than the national population registerlink in a gazette notification issued on july 31  2019  the modi government passed an order to prepare and update the population register in every state other than assamcredits for info on nprcreditcredit c  arguments against nrc i a botched exercise in assamthe national register of citizens in assam was updated over the past few years to identify undocumented migrants who had come mostly from bangladesh after 1971 the updated nrc was supposed to document all those people whose names were listed in the nrc of 1951 and were still alive as well as their living descendants who could prove they were permanent residents of the stateit was a botched exercise there were many errors during the processsource in all  around 19 lakh people in assam were excluded from the final register sourcesoon  the bjp started complaining that many undocumented immigrants had been included in the register  while around five lakh bengali hindus were excluded in fact  even some people who had campaigned for the bjp found themselves excludedsource bjp complaining about a botched nrcsource 5 lakh bengali hindus excluded in nrcsource bjp campaigners find themselves excludedanyone who is not able to prove citizenship under nrc is put in detention centresreports of the violation of human rights in these detention centres is alarmingsource a newborn died in a detention centre in assam their mother was later found not to be a foreigner ii loopholes and inconsistencies in the existing citizenship lawsthere is a lot of speculation around cut off dates and proving of ancestry based on the pilot nrc launched in assam but nothing concrete so far can be determined since the nation wide bill hasnt been draftedbut one thing we know for sure  every person resident in india will be required to prove their citizenshiphow does one prove their citizenship?this is where matters get complexif we dont consider the speculated ancestry provision which may or may not be included in the nation wide nrc  the current law for citizenship is as follows the citizenship act defines a citizen assection 3citizenship by birth  1  except as provided in subsection  2   every person born in india  a  on or after the 26th day of january  1950  but before the 1st day of july  1987  b  on or after the 1st day of july  1987  but before the commencement of the citizenship  amendment  act  2003 and either of whose parents is a citizen of india at the time of his birth  c  on or after the commencement of the citizenship  amendment  act  2003  where i  both of his parents are citizens of india  or ii  one of whose parents is a citizen of india and the other is not an illegal migrant at the time of his birth  shall be a citizen of india by birthshort of this is if you were born in india before 1987 but after 1950  you are a citizenif you were born after 1987 but before 2003 and either of your parents are indian citizens  you are a citizenif you were born after 2003 and both your parents are indian citizens or one of your parents is an indian citizen and the other is not an illegal immigrant  you are a citizenso if you were born before 1987  youre an indian citizen by birthif youre born after 1987 you have to prove that your parents are indian citizens  what about the orphans? how do you do it?if youre born before 1987  you can prove citizenship by provision of birth certificate or other documents as may be prescribed by the nrcassuming your parents were educated and organised enough they would be able to preserve your birth certificate and other such documents but people from lower middle class or slightly under privileged backgrounds may not have done the same because they werent educated and informed enough about the importance of these documents this leaves a person in a state of handicapif youre born after 1987  considering that  almost 44 of indias population is under  24 years of age and a total 85 of the population is under 54 years of age  we can safely conclude the above group constitutes a large chunk of indias populationyou have to prove that at least one of your parents is an indian citizen so if youre born after 1987 naturally your parents are born before 1987 youll have to provide the necessary documents of your parentsto prove theyre indian citizens basically they expect you to preserve and possess documents dating back to as much as the 1960smany news agencies are reporting that mere submitting of passports and aadhar cards shall suffice and this is absolutely falsemere submitting of passports  birth certificate shall not suffice to prove citizenship  this was ruled by bombay high court in 2013sourcein conclusion 67 of our population is still rural as per the 2015 census this coupled with inadequate infrastructure and lacking admin capacities to implement a nationwide program like this would be a disaster iii why nrc promotes inequality against the muslims?imagine a scenario where a nationwide npr is rolled out the babus administering the exercise mess up and end up sending a whole bunch of people  of all faiths a specified proforma from the register now  a legal recourse is available only to people of the six religions mentioned in the caa do note that the law specifically says that people belonging to these faiths shall not be treated as illegal migrants muslims  however  will not have any such recourse for that matter  even jews wont be able to do anything about their exclusion from the register as a result  lakhs and crores of excluded people might have to declare that they are illegal immigrants to become indian citizens againthe tricky part is proving religious  persecution in another countryto benefit from the caa  the person issued a specified proforma by the npr must prove that  one  they are a nonmuslim migrant from afghanistan  pakistan or bangladesh  and  two  that they came to india to escape religious persecution  read with the point mentioned in caa  but because the government can make the rules under the passport act essentially at whim  the government can simply strike out the second condition and keep only the firstcredit iv economic costthe global economy is on a slowdown and india is no exception to it  i generally never attribute gdp numbers with a government since the only active participation of a government in a gdp is via public expenditure which is still crucial however  when a government actively makes policies which are detrimental to the state of the economy  then fingers will be pointedthis is the case with nrc in assam alone it cost 1220 crores  1500 crores and ended up in a massive failuresource the national cost of implementing the nrc would run into lakhs of crores with the indian economy in its current situation  implementing nrc would surely leave a visible dent on the indian economy especially when there is absence of any roi  return on investment  from such a policythe estimated cost of this might be close to 23 lakh crores  unverified source this is an opinion piece and the figures may have the effect of being inflated or underestimatedsay  it costs 3 lakh crores  its still just 157 of our last years gdp ie 272 trillionhowever  just like demonetisation this act will bring the country to a halt people will have to line up yet again at verification centres  for document verification  follow ups  enquiries in assam  the nrc updating started on july 30  2018 and ended on august 31  2019 and despite taking over an year to complete this process  the entire process ended up in material inconsistencies and glaring errorssourcea nationwide implementation would cost years in loss of productivity and the economic cost of this practice would be dangerousdemonetisation caused the gdp growth to drop to 61  though it recovered in the later quarters and consumption patterns stabilised toosourceover 15 million jobs were lost in q3 of fy 201617 post implementation of demonetisationsource cmie reportthe nation wide implementation of nrc will have a similar or larger impact on the economy but this time it will come with a substantial human cost v cost of errorthe nrc exercise would be highly prone to errorboth type i and type ii explanationtype i errors  false positives mistakenly identifying a person as an immigrant from protected minority communities such as hindus  sikhs  buddhists  jains  parsis and christians from afghanistan  bangladesh  and pakistan  and erroneously giving them the benefit of indian citizenship immigrants are usually a net economic benefit  so the costs of type i errors are only confined to national security these costs are not nationwide and typically limited to a handful of border districts in indiatype ii errors false negativesthese occur when those who qualify as indian citizens are mistakenly categorized as illegal immigrants a nationwide nrc  if similar to the one in assam  would imply that false negatives get sent to detention centres or deportedtype ii errors are extremely costly to minimize false negatives  the bar to qualify as a citizen has to be very simple and easily identifiable also  infrastructure to scrutinize the paperwork for the nrc has to be exceptionally efficient the indian state usually fails on both counts given the cabs current religious exclusionary basis  muslims are at higher risk of exclusion through false negatives  though all groups  including hindus  are likely to be affected by errorsthere are three main issues to consider here the first is the tradeoff between type i and type ii errors if  to avoid false positives  the government has a high level of scrutiny for nrc inclusion  all individuals will have the burden of meeting this higher bar in the process  some might be mistakenly excluded on the other hand  if the bar is set very low to prevent false negatives and erroneous exclusions  then some illegal immigrants may slip through the cracks the current cab framework  combined with the nrc  is set up to minimize false positives  which will automatically increase false negativesthe third issue is of the magnitude of error1  if govt executes well with 5 error  675 million people will be displaced  equalling displacement by ww ii 2  if it has aadhaar error rate  88  120 million will be left out3  if it has 1 error  still 135 million indians will be displaced  same as partition of india both the source materials for the data above are opinion pieces since the numbers can only be estimated as of now and should be read accordinglysourcesourceplease share this with others who may find this information useful and open up discussions with supporters of the caa billhope this helped jai hindfootnoteopinion there are a lot of narratives around the caa and nrc but one thing that we need to stress on too is that illegal immigrants coming to india are disenfranchised and very poor to blanket categorise them as some evil infiltrators stealing our lands and jobs is unfair and inhumane,Areychampa, source1 http  censusindiagovin 2011actrules notifications citizenship_rules2003pdf source2 https  indiankanoonorg doc 377118  credit1 https

objective and reliable hey im an indian muslim and the last 3 months in india have been a complete nightmare i saw your post a while back and really appreciated the time you took to lay everything down with sources  easy to absorb for a while i tried to get other people to read it too  but most people arent really readers  and not into politics either  especially if it doesnt affect them directly so it inspired me to create a youtube video with sources  much like yours i tried to keep it entertaining  without being inappropriate   and sprinkled it with pop culture memes and animations so even if people werent politically inclined  they watched it i couldnt fit all your points into it  as it was too long but i just wanted to extend my deepest gratitude for your post  as this is

the need for social distancing and many workplaces putting into place work from home plans  voice and data connectivity become critical to ensure that high quality bandwidth is available to all parts of india we have suggested specific steps to be taken by the department of telecom ### we the people  of the internetdue to the unprecedented nature of the covid19 pandemic  the union government is taking various policy measures to safeguard the health and welfare of all indians as per an advisory by the ministry of health and family welfare titled  advisory on social distancing measure in view of spread of covid19 disease   link  https  wwwmohfwgovin pdf socialdistancingadvisorybymohfwpdf   point number 3 to this advisory recommends to  encourage private sector organizations employers to allow employees to work from home wherever feasible a work from home measure is critical during this time to contain adverse economic impacts on individuals  companies and the entire indian economyat the same time during this period many people are likely to undergo mental stress and will reach out to loved ones for comfort and support even for children  remote educational modes of learning will become vital at this time as schools are closed many such interests which require social distancing necessary to restrict the spread of covid19 are supported by the availability of telecom and data services however  as is the case with such a measure we would like to highlight that there comes certain network capacity related risks which policymakers must respond to a recent report in the new

networks moreover  wifi based home internet systems have their own set of challenges in terms of reliability and quality of service ### we need to have a plan to support each otherwe urge for crucial policy measures by putting forth a comprehensive plan in coordination with appropriate government departments and ministries we specifically suggest the following1 periodic reviews of telecom infrastructure constraints there is an urgent need for the dot and trai to conduct assessments in consultation with large telecom and internet service providers on the capacity to carry voice and internet traffic separately  theres a need for authorities to engage with representatives from internet users both enterprise facing stakeholders and consumer facing stakeholders in challenges they may face in continuing their day to day activities online all of these actions must nonetheless  uphold the spirit of net neutrality and not lead to discriminatory treatment of internet traffic2 encourage voluntary pledges by telecom companies we recommend that a voluntary pledge may be encouraged by the union government in which telecom and internet service providers decide to not terminate services of any residential or small business users because of their inability to pay their bills due to disruptions caused specifically by covid19 3 ensure full and complete access at all times we urge that an advisory may be issued to all state governments to halt any internet shutdowns or actions under the telecommunications suspension rules  2017 which are likely to increase hardship for people and organisations this includes measures which slow down internet access speeds since that has the potential cripple economic activitieswe urge people from across the community  especially

can the bhakts say so?the constitution is only valid so long as the people of the country choose to hold it as valid pieces of paper have no power or sovereignty  they derive sovereignty from the people the people have chosen to reject the constitution  because heres the kicker  the constitution and india are  and have always been  an inherently instable construct the ideas of a secular india has always been deeply antithetical precisely because india is _not_ a nation by any rational definition of a nation india is a hastily cobbledtogether postcolonial creation that validates itself solely by creating an enemy  first the british empire  justifiably so  and then pakistan  unjustifiable  and bangladesh  horrendously cruel it is these chickens that are  today  coming home to roost  because indias latent hindutva was incredible easy to exploit it always existed  it just lacked someone to point it out and now that people are told that their hindutva is threatened  the only justification they have always given themselves for the existence of their nation is collapsing  and they will shred the institutions meant to keep democracy safe just to keep their hindu project safeindia should never happened  the country was a postcolonial error  britains final kick to south asia  and pretending it could ever be a secular country was a mistake secular nations are built on tangible cultures and cultural beliefs with concrete identities  like european nations  or indian states india was always hindutva  and hindutva was always india  all it lacked was the spark to set fire to the hatred and xenophobia that always existed  because that hatred is what justifies indias existencetear the republic down and demand statehood for your state  which is currently subjugated by india and indianness sovereignty derives from a mandate of people living in consensus  and india will never have consensus that isnt phony and manufactured that is the only way you can guarantee a better future for those not particularly religiously inclined the idea of a nation is based on commonality of languageculture we preach unity in diversity and at the same time we also preach others to be indian first these 2 messages are contradictory  why do we have to forgo our cultural identities to be an indian if being indian is just embracing the diversity?   therein lies the real problem  the so called national politics is stuck in a time capsule of north centric postpartition hindumuslim conflict there is no nuance or logic to this narrative  bjp considers hindu nation as a foregone conclusion based on partition whereas the other side doesnt have any retort other than lets not be a hindu pakistanliberals have lost the ideological battle because theyre living in their own little worlds where they imagine india to be something its not majority of indians dont give a damn about progressive liberal beliefs and are drawn towards charismatic leaders who talk in platitudes what is the alternative to modi? raga? secularism is a noble state policy but it cannot be the only basis for a nation the only ideological challenge hindutva currently faces is nativism from states such as tamil nadubengal assamese opposition to cab is also the same phenomenon  assamese speakers have fallen below 50 in their own state and they dont want to fall any lower than that forget hindu texts  they dont even have to study the constitutionliberals have spent the better part of 70+ years deconstructing and pointing out all the flaws of hinduism but have done little to no attempt at highlighting the good aspects of hinduism to create a positive liberal hindu identity bjp has exploited this hindu identity vacuum by claiming that they understandrespect the good aspects of hinduism   people who wouldve sided with liberals now side with bjp because they respect hinduism  however superficial it may be you should read  this article  https  wwwlivemintcom opinion jyzfxtxjd2igqpqa3mgofn narendramodiandthemysteryofthehindulefthtml  for more details islamophobiayoure playing right into bjps hands by using this term bjp canwill use an uno reverse card and label you as hinduphobic  bottomlineyou cannot defeat hindu identity politics by appealing to secularismconstitution ad nauseam  you have to create a political liberal hindu identity in opposition to their bigoted one and market it to the masses that is the only way i can see hindutva going down in summary1 bjp wants to change india into hindu rashtra2 muslims  christians  dalits and people who take the constitution and secularism seriously will oppose that3 hence the bjp is hiding its intentions now  it has to change peoples perceptions to normalize hindutva even more than it is normalized currently4 so how does it justify its fascism? by creating the conditions necessary for its justification5 muslims protesting in the streets will be portrayed as pakistanis or jihadis who want india to become an islamic state6 students will be seen as supporting pakistan and jihadis  hence antinationals  they want to break india into pieces7 intellectuals are antinationals and urban naxals  maybe even supporting china8 slurs such as these were merely slurs  not to be taken seriously  but now theyll become actual accusations  with perhaps legal  or extralegal  consequences 9 a conflict with pakistan  or a very tangible fear of one  will help these slurs become real accusations10 thus bjp can justify further fascist policies like detention centres  which they deny now   and even unthinkable ones,2019-12-23 06:10:30

force a fire sale of indian government assets maybe we are up for the biggest wealth transfer to the richest elite in this country since demonetization? or am i wearing my tin foil hat a little too tight?edit spelling,H1ken, one of the biggest reasons for this slowdown is the death of private consumption it was the only wheel that was sustaining the economy now with rural consumption taking a hit  the government is clueless to revive demand it needs to pump that rbi surplus as development expenditure  but it risks increasing the inflation with lower income rates and if inflation rises the government is on for a disasterlong story short  the government is walking on fire why not both? their cluelessness contributed to the current slowdown  but they are also corrupt enough to use this opportunity to transfer air india etc to adani et al for cheapalso privatization does not have to be the governments brain child it could simply be the governments friends seeing an opportunity and them convincing the government  force a fire sale of indian government assetsthis is a good rationale actually keep the tinfoil hat  well see more patterns like this i am more interested in knowing what microsoft did to nokia? it will happen there are a lot of psus that the govt wants to rid of  but who will buy it when the buyers themselves are in a slump? 1  global recession was long forecasted for 2020 2  we failed to capitalise opportunity to get business from china 3  indian economy rested on what we call black money   addition of cluster mess which we call gst further compounded it  lack of government trust  and dynamic policies and if that was not enough the accumulation of money from middle class to elite few who wont invest leads to the perfect concoction to kick down our economy dont forget recession is part of economy cycle probable future we should expect deflation of economy which will lead to lower product costs but also more job losses possible but unlikely govt may decrease interest rate in favor of inflation  now do remember most people use interest as investment option and they may get fked   but i dont see it increasing borrowings new minted currencies + deflation + lower currency exchange value against usd may lead us down to zimbabwe root inviting the top minds of r india? 246000 replies coming up damn rightwe were once the 3310 of world economysigh in a free economy  people have choice to use either cash or electronic  banking medium cash has its own positives and cons once printed  it goes through thousands of extra transactions with no extra significant cost however  the electronic transactions charge per transaction both the system should compete  and people can choose cash shouldnt be a dirty word its hard to predict as this recession seems to be a cyclic one  its not just india but globally the investment is slowing there are many factors that can be attributed to current downturn and for every industry theres a different reason what i believe is that india in actuality never recovered well from 2008  while in fiscal terms we were out of recession very quickly this was in parts fuelled by the excessive lending during 200912 from various public private sector bankstill 2013 coupled with high crude oil prices economy loomed  around 2014 crude oil prices decreased but the effects of npas started kicking in economy during the same time many big loans started converted to npas and the every single month the npas ballooned in between the central governments implementation of gst and demonetisation fractured a lot of domestic consumption  as a lot of it depended on black money   this is my personal opinion    the current government failed to control the npas till q1 fy19 when there was reduction of stocks of npas  by rs21 000 cr the government now has started to refinance these banks and merge them  although merging shouldnt have been a priority  while it wasnt a bad step per say the surplus that government skimmed from rbi a part of it might be used for psb recapitalisation which seems to be a good step  again its hard to predict anything when it comes to economy its a dynamic system of scale that no one can comprehendrich will always get richer  theres no problem in that i believe the important issue is for the countries large population   india    is to deliver jobs and grow middle class with a lot of manufacturing automation   automation it would be hard to grow a middle class   again this is an assumption    at this stage its very difficult to predict to what extent automation is going to affect the job market now coming to selling assets   may be or may be not theres no singular answer i think governments montenisation plans on noncore assets is fine  if some business   riches can get even more rich through clever understanding of indian bureaucracy its still not a bad deal   not atleast for an average tax paying indian middle class citizen   we wont have to shell out money for operations of various cpses that are a burden on our pockets the biggest concern is how this government has a socialistic attitude for the poor and a capitalistic outtake for ultrarich there is a very little concern for middle class  anyhow this is nothing new we need to stop relying on central   state governments  as for our business rather than expecting government to provide incentive for domestic business   like china does     a lot of our business have to grow global ambitions rather than fixating ourselves on indian domestic market i dont think the toxic mix of bureaucrats who are selected through upsc with questionable hiring process and politicians will be mature enough to understand the dynamic global market while its an extremely painstaking process but i do see a lot of business growing in core engineering services in india   from mobile transceivers  sdr to custom asics   who are actually making a lot of money leaving aside fancy ai   ml   essentially decorated statisticians     there are huge opportunities in global markets  only if we have vision and risk taking aptitude our economy is not just and shouldnt solely depend on a immature government structure#x200b       1   economictimesindiatimescom articleshow 65845118cms?frommdrutm_sourcecontentofinterestutm_mediumtextutm_campaigncppst  https  economictimesindiatimescom articleshow 65845118cms?frommdrutm_sourcecontentofinterestutm_mediumtextutm_campaigncppst ,2019-09-03 18:33:39
Policy/Economy,essential features of a rights respecting data protection law,20,faprl4,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/faprl4/essential_features_of_a_rights_respecting_data/,0,https  previewreddit w3igtx7vnlj41png?width1024formatpngautowebpsf9d61bc619966e39747319b263d1e649d649382atl driff has responded to the call for public comments and suggestions by the joint committee on the personal data protection  pdp  bill  2019 and sent across a submission on behalf of the #saveourprivacy campaign in it we have provided substantive inputs on essential privacy principles and a thematic analysis of major issues with the bill we have also appended a public brief containing a highlevel clause by clause analysis of the bill additionally  we have appended two issue specific briefs on  a  workplace surveillance and  b  the relationship between the pdp bill and the national population register   essential first principlesas a first step we apprised the committee that since the right to privacy as recognised by the supreme court also includes informational privacy this should be the primary lens through which the eventual law should be framed in this regard  we also mentioned that the supreme court in the right to privacy judgement  ks puttaswamy v union of india  made the observation that the right to privacy subsists in public spaces as well in this regard  we highlighted that a lot of users experiences online occur in certain corners of the internet which are public semipublic in nature therefore  indias data protection law must respect that and therefore accord adequate privacy protections in these domains  in addition  we noted that the joint committee could shape indias data protection law to incorporate the  seven privacy principles  https  saveourprivacyin principles  of the indian privacy code  2018 which was developed by the #saveourprivacy campaign these principles are based on the honble supreme courts decision in ks puttaswamy v union of india and global examples like the european unions  eus  general data protection regulation the seven privacy principles emphasise that individual rights should be at the center of privacy and data protection and that the government should respect user privacy they also address the need for the creation of a strong supervisory authority  and for surveillance reform   major concerns that should be addressed by the committeesubsequently we have done a thematic analysis of our top substantive concerns with the pdp bill this includes but is not limited to themes such as  1  inclusion and treatment of social media intermediaries in the billthe bill requires social media platforms identified as significant data fiduciaries to set up infrastructure which allows users in india to voluntarily verify their accounts this measure hampers online anonymity and thereby the right to privacy additionally  it will allow social media entities to access peoples government issued identity documents this can lead to aggregation of demographic information across different social media companies and databases this creates immense scope for companies to build granular user profiles and commercialise personal and sensitive personal data of individuals we therefore ask the committee to remove this provision from the pdp bill  2  need for a chapter on surveillance reformpresently  india does not have sufficient privacy safeguards in place when it comes to surveillance carried out by the government the frameworks currently in place  under indias information technology act and the telegraph act  are geared towards national security and fail to adequately protect privacy in particular there is a lack of sufficient institutional or legislative oversight thus  we have proposed that there is a need for a separate chapter on surveillance reform in the bill along the lines of the indian privacy code  2018  3  exceptions for central government to access nonpersonal dataa provision in the pdp bill  clause 91  provides a carveout for the central government to access anonymised or nonpersonal data to frame policies in the interest of its digital economy such provisions show that the proposed law is far more interested in treating data as a resource we believe that a data protection law should not be used as a legislative backdoor to commodify data  4  issues with proposed structure of the data protection authority  dpa  and the accompanying appellate structure the selection committee consists of secretarylevel officials two issues that arise here are of i  accountability  these are neither democratically elected nor judicial members   and ii  diversity  it doesnt reflect executive  judicial and external expertise  thus  we have proposed having an open call for applications and for the selection committee to have be inclusive in terms of representation we have noted that the bill impairs the independence of the dpa by allowing the government to frame policies which will be binding on them to ensure quicker and localised decision making  we have proposed having state and regional dpa benches we think that as things stand  the appellate tribunal would lack transparency to that end  we have proposed that it must publish all its decisions   5  the reasonable purposes exemption which allows personal data to be processed without consent for reasonable purposes under clause 14 of the billthe exemptions granted under this clause are fairly wide it classifies publicly available personal data as under the reasonable purposes category we think that this is a backdoor towards profiling and allow collation of demographic individual sentiments on issues we also think this would allow the government  and other powerful data fiduciaries  to aggregate social networking activities without the need for individual consent the right to privacy is applicable in public spaces therefore  we proposed that this provision be removed from the reasonable purposes exception since it is an excessive encroachment on peoples privacy in public spaces  in addition to these themes  there are also other major issues with the bill that we have discussed at length in our submission the #saveourprivacy collective has also authored briefs and explainers on different areas of the pdp bill we are sharing them with the jpc  the public and other relevant stakeholders in the hope that our analysis can inform future outcomes  important documents1 covering letter of the #saveourprivacy submission to the joint parliamentary committee   link

Policy/Economy,the problem with bjp supporters,70,ed1ehe,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ed1ehe/the_problem_with_bjp_supporters/,16,okay  so this is my first ever post on reddit i have been a keen observer of indian politics since the last 6 years i was a voter who voted for bjp in good faith thinking that they are different from other parties but since the last few years my view point has completely changed but this post wont discuss about the actions of bjp that led to the change in my political stance  but this would rather be a post about what is the real problem with the bjp supporters i might be wrong here but here are some of my observations from my personal experience 1  bjp fans simply dont understand that you can simultaneously oppose two political parties as soon as you start debating them on a certain issue  they will straight away associate you with congress  communists or even with a terrorist they believe that every one who is against bjp has joined a faction 2  staunch bjp fans certainly dont realize that a person isnt against the nation if they are against bjp  they just rebrand you anti national even if you ask logical questions on government policies these people are forgetting that we have every right to question the government and protest if we dont think something is right that is what distinguishes us from a country like north korea or saudi arabia we do not have a king  rather we have a prime minister who is responsible for answering us 3  bjp supporters tend to discredit each and every source which criticizes the government these people are just not ready to accept the fact that someone who is not affiliated to any political party can criticize the government if a post or a newspaper article condemns the government  they simply start calling it anti indian or congress sponsored propaganda 4  bjp supporters also use a tool called whataboutism they justify their wrongdoing by referring to the wrongdoing of other parties for example  okay bjp is corrupt but what about congress it was more corrupt but they do not understand that this does not change the fact that even bjp is corrupt  and if you are trying to bring positive changes you cannot repeat the same mistakes that your predecessors have made 5  bjp supporters cant accept the fact that a person can do both constructive and destructive work i agree that bjp has also brought in some positive changes  but that doesnt justify its wrongdoing you can appreciate and criticize a person at the same time just because you have voted for them shouldnt make them immune to your criticism you chose them to represent you  you have every right to criticize their actions and appreciate any good work 6  even if they can clearly see that bjp is playing communal politics  they will turn a blind eye to it they say congress played a dirtier one  again whataboutism at its best congress played communal politics  that is the reason you voted against them but if the new party also starts doing the same how can you support them only on the basis of your vote  7  as soon as a communal card is played like mandir the bjp fans will always deviate from real issues like economy  poverty  economic reforms  business investments their first priority will become to resolve that petty issue rather than the real ones so my thoughts on this issue is that in this day and age we are still fighting for the issues that the british wanted us to fight on religion  once upon a time it was used to unite people but right now it is only playing a divisive role we as the modern generation have to stop taking pride in our religion and just not get emotional while voting on the basis of your religion it does not matter whatever degree you have because if you caste your votes on the basis of just being from a particular religion then the value of getting that education goes to zero dont let social media dictate your perspective  do your own research and make your own mindset rather than following the mindset of the crowd i would seriously like you guys to give your insight on this post thank you,vardhan68, every point is spot on a physics prof from iit madras is my friend and we endlessly point out to him that anti bjp isnt pro congrss i mean this is a guy who has learnt topology where a set that is not open need not be closed either and still doesnt get this they dont know what critical thinking iswhatsapp university  modia and it cell has brainwashed them bjp knows what racists indians want to hear and spews that out over and over thats why we call them bhaktsfor them opposing bhand janta party is blasphemy i agree with all these points the saddest thing that has happened to me is i am no longer able to talk to my friends from highschool  we were friends since class 9th and since he supports modi unconditionally he wouldnt even listen to me so i hate this party and politics for this they have polarized us alot the biggest problem i see is that they lie blatantly its so hard to have a good faith argument because they try to use every trick in the book except honesty very nicely said great job by seeing all this text it is understood that you have done lot of debate and argument with peoplein a way u hv defended our great nation and tried to make it a better place u defended it not at the border but from inside so great job i could agree more i am so glad that people are starting to see the reality of things great job yea and its absolutely right to call every bjp supporter  which far exceeds any other people  illiterate  bhakt and it cell if they support bjp and living yourself with pseudo superiority complex while thinking yourself as a intellectual just because you dont support bjp  right?,2019-12-20 12:57:54
Policy/Economy,you yes its you do it,69,ekjgwb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ekjgwb/you_yes_its_you_do_it/,6,its high time already its so bad that a lurker has to post this have always been one  so as to never degrade the content quality of the sub but  assessing the current political situation has made me impromptu promptly write thisim not here to be a keyboard warrior by bashing the fascist leader and gain karma out of itinstead  ill lay down a plan to tackle the current regime it only deals with their propaganda power since it has time and again proven that propaganda plays a major role in convincing people to support or commit atrocities this is the pillar that provides support to the oncoming fascism lets break them into pieces 1  since  lack of karma has refrained me from writing things in other subs as a sound citizen  we need you to get our situation to be heard globally  like the hongkong protest  henceforth  fella redditors with high karma and eloquent writing skills do post articles  videos  engage in group discussions happening in global subs like world news  politics and many more subs that has their presence in the front pageuse your meme knowledge  post and repost memes to subs like memes  dank meme  meme economy and so on2  whatsapp is the breeding ground for bjp propaganda inorder to counter this  we need you to post videos highlighting the hypocrisy of this party especially the ones that official peeing human uploads tweet him asking for an offline download link of his vidoes or do download it by illegal means   anything illegal for greater good is good do not post link to the videos midlife crisis unkills and aunties wont open the link and watch it even if they did  not gonna watch more than 5 seconds they are brainwashed in thinking modi is the superman thats gonna save their arse from monotonous life do not send them to a liberals den they identify themselves as bhakt due to the sheer propaganda and will refute to believe any of it hence  remove the doctrine slowly administer the truth little by little in their silly heads truth is  if they can be brainwashed to an extend that can support this regime without giving any batshit about the trend of the country they can be rewired to think in the right way as well sharing offline videos in whatsapp groups will definitely make them watch it accidentally atleat once since  they are prone to clicking it on their phone gallery  apparently most of them dont care to even delete it lateryou will obviously face criticism from your family  friends and acquaintances by sharing the videos in their whatsapp group calm your nerves down do not engage in a rebuttal with them keep posting every hour every day things will change people who blindly supported the partys claims will progressively begin to think about it they may not change their stand an overnight  a week  a month or forever but will definitely cross think about the situation and will not start shouting slogans praising this fascist regimedo add photos and videos highlighting great leaders celebrities experts of any field expressing their opinions do quote golden words said by past leaders and dictators regarding the fascismshare pictures of scientific data and statistics highlighting the economic growth  unemployment     trend and so on might seem like a silly thing to do but things like these are definitely the ones that pulled them in supporting bjp in the first place3  eloquent writers of this sub please write messages that serves like a whatsapp forward messages  you know  like the share with five groups to charge your smartphone to 100 mods  please make an active thread on it allow us to copy and share it in the other online mediasuse your wit and style  to enhance the power of the message do not label an ignorant or a brainwashed mind as a bhakt or sanghi i trusted modi by the partys propaganda thinking they did good for the nation unlike the mainstream propaganda  i fell prey to the pretentious quoran who bags the number one place in followers count he sold lies without telling lies he never lied about the policy and regulations government made instead  he bent and twisted the facts in favour of the party he sold hopes after every failure of the governments action hes a prime example of an educated moron he highlights the fact that an educated mind is not equivalent as an intellects mindsorry it turned into a rantwanted yall to know how a budding mind like mine fell to his black magic his educational credentials is what makes growing and educated minds fall for such propaganda trap if i hadnt stumbled upon this platform  i wouldve remained a bhakth even now change starts from your home dont involve in a verbal abuse or quarrel with your hardcore right wing conservative family if they are one instead  keep mumbling about the countrys situation then and now like a casual talklet their mind process iteducate them about history like how hitler rose to power and how our country is trying to be the 1930s germanyunlike the nazis  who had control over the media back then ie the newspapers and radio which was and is only onesided where the true mind couldnt express the truth our generation is blessed enough to have countless online presence and mode of communication is much easier and two sidedbrainwash the minds into thinking rightdo not outcast them into a different sect this will only create chaos their sadness will be disguised in the form anger this will make them loathe our ideologies and ultimately send them into the deep pit of what propaganda machines dugrather listen to their side and make them understand i dont know how many of the downvoted answers  comments were genuinely by people who just needed to hear the other side

Policy/Economy,i transcribed the full text of dr manmohan singhs remarks on economic mismanagement by the current government in india,728,czvagp,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/czvagp/i_transcribed_the_full_text_of_dr_manmohan_singhs/,161,transcript of the remarks by indias former prime minister  dr manmohan singh  about economic mismanagement under the modi government sept 1 2019the state of the economy today is deeply worrying the last quarters gdp growth rate of 5 percent signals that we are in the midst of a prolonged slowdown india has the potential to grow at a much faster rate  but allround mismanagement by the modi government has resulted in this slowdownit is particularly distressing that the manufacturing sectors growth is tottering at 06 percent this makes it very clear that our economy has not yet recovered from the manmade blunders of demonetisation and a hastily implemented gst domestic demand is depressed and consumption growth is at an 18 month low nominal gdp growth is at 15 year lowthere is a gaping hole in tax revenues tax buoyancy remains elusive as businessmen  small and big  are hounded  and tax terrorism continues unabated investor sentiment are in doldrums these are not the foundations for economic recoverythe modi governments policies are resulted in massive jobless growth more than 35 lakh jobs have been lost in the automobile sector alone there will similarly be large scale job losses in the informal sector  hurting our most vulnerable workersrural india is in terrible shape our farmers are not receiving adequate prices and rural incomes have declined the low inflation rate that the modi government likes to showcase comes at the cost of our farmers and their income  by inflicting misery on over 50 percent of indias populationinstitutions are under attack  and their autonomy is being eroded the resilience of the reserve bank will be tested after its record transfer of rupees 176 lakh crore to the government  which claims that it does not have a plan on what it will do with this windfall in addition  the credibility of indias data has come under question under this governmentbudget announcements and rollbacks have shaken the confidence of international investors india has not been able to increase the exports to take advantage of opportunities that have arisen in global trade due to geopolitical realignment such is the state of economic management under the modi governmentour youth  our farmers and our farm workers  entrepreneurs  and the marginalised section deserve better india cannot afford to continue down this path therefore  i urge the government to put aside vendetta politics and reach out to all sane voices and thinking minds to steer our economy out of this manmade crisis,firasd, whats particularly angering to me is that the bjp listened to all this and then came out and made a completely unrelated and irrelevant attack on dr mms by calling him a puppet of the congress leadershipwhether or not he was  i fail to understand how that is connected to the statement dr mms had made on the economyand then they went ahead and said that the economy is working fine under the modi government i mean like wtf? then why did the rbi transfer an unprecedented 176 lakh crore to the government? why did the fin min rollback some of the budgetary provisions to implement new ones? why is your niti aayog leadership and the economic advisors to the pm affirming that there indeed is a slowdown? why are core sectors performing pathetically? why are factories closing up?matlab  chutiya samaj rakha hai bas literally lying to our faces at least acknowledge that there is a problem solving it comes later in the process  deleted   rural india is in terrible shape our farmers are not receiving adequate prices and rural incomes have declined the low inflation rate that the modi government likes to showcase comes at the cost of our farmers and their income  by inflicting misery on over 50 percent of indias populationto me  this is the single biggest blunder the demo was big but one time blunder whereas  ignoring the farm crisis year on year is an even bigger blunder you cannot say we have managed inflation by putting more than 50 of the population in severe debt and income crisis thats not how you manage inflation and thats exactly why this bjp govt has got the basics of economics wrong and even now  i am afraid that all the subsidies are going to go to industries sure you can artificially increase the production and trade through govt intervention but only for a limited period of time because who would consume what is produced when 50 of the population have had very poor income and are in debt i really really hope that govt invests into the rural market that is the need of the hour but are they listening?

there are clear and abundant examples of what happens around the world when corp tax rates are decreased without a simultaneous effort to tackle the underlying problems of a stuttering economybasic economic policy will tell you that in economies with deman side issues  an income tax cut will have far better and far more extensive implications that a corp tax cutfucking idiots the bunch of them and all you morons that celebrate this,FlamingNostrils, the eli5 version for those who didnt understand op taxes are how government get the money to run itself  when taxes are reduced  government revenue falls  modi kaka has reduced the taxes for his corporate buddies the resulting  tax reduction  of around 27   https  wwwnationalheraldindiacom national corporatetaxcutsapanicreactiontotideoverchoppysensexcongress  means government will lose around 145 lakh crore in tax revenue now  remember that the government had forced rbi to give it 175 lakh crore to boost the economy?  so effectively  government tax cut will cause a loss of 145 lakh crore  and rbi money will be used to make up for it in effect  modi kaka is using our money so that corporates can get richer and share their wealth with him so that he can continue to dress in style  through 15+ lakh suit boot bribes gifts  and ensure bjp remains the richest political party in indiaops analysis op points out that businesses will just use the money from tax cut to shore up themselves  by buying their own stocks or giving bigger bonuses  op points that the real problem currently is that people are not buying anything less demands mean business have to reduce production as people are buying less reducing production means some workers have less or no work to do so businesses will reduce the work force some businesses will reduce salary of workforce net effect  there will be less and less money to buy things reduced demands means more business loss and job cuts op suggests an income tax rate cut would help with this if people have more money in hand  they will invest and spend more an income tax rate cut is one way to ensure salaried people have more money the centre of the governments policy in dealing with the economic slowdown has been to offer sops to the supply side when nearly every economist is convinced that the problem stems from low demand source  nirmala sitharaman ignores the recipe to get out of the mess suggested by manmohan singh  https  wwwnationalheraldindiacom opinion nirmalasitharamanignorestherecipetogetoutofthemesssuggestedbymanmohansingh  we have had slowdowns in the past but india has never experienced a contraction in sales because of reduced consumer demand source  finance minister nirmala sitharaman  in panic  is barking up the wrong tree  https  wwwnationalheraldindiacom opinion financeministernirmalasitharamaninpanicisbarkingupthewrongtree eli5 of trickle down economy concept under which this big tax cut for corporate is defended the trickle down economic theory claims that benefits to the wealthy trickle down to everyone else these benefits are usually tax cuts on businesses  highincome earners  capital gains  and dividends the theory says that only rich people can drive economic growth so it proposes tax cuts only for the wealthy  and not a general tax cut for everyone it also proposes that the cuts have to be big for it to work  based on  laffer curve  https  wwwinvestopediacom terms l laffercurveasp  theory  it promises that the wealthy will use the extra money from the tax cuts to invest more  and expand business this in turn will create more jobs or better jobs  higher salary  thus  new jobs or higher salary mean people will spend more money and thus boost the economy  this was applied by reagan and bush in the usa during both the reagan and bush era  the economy improved but reagan had also increased government spending bush had also lowered federal fund rates  so loans became cheaper  so critics do not accept that the trickle down tax cut theory helped the economy  they point out that during both reagan and bush era  inequality between the wealthy and the poor increased the top onefifth of the rich increased their income by 80 the top 1 percent tripled their income so instead of trickling down  the wealthy just became wealthier privatisation of profit and socialisation of loss bhai  simple chutiya people deserve chutiyi goverment abhi aagey aagey dekho hota kya hai bas koi bhi sector main government kuch announcement karde  raato raat sab expert banjayenge aur kahenge how this is better for us eg  demo  gst  abhi economymodiji bjp tatti bhi laake denge toh log kahega wah ye toh amrit hai bjp is comparing this to 1991 economic reforms we live in a time when subsidies and loan waiver to poor is considered freebies and doling out money to corporates is considered essential for boosting business the underlying logics are just bizarre govt dont understand the meaning of reserve in rbi these  govt  are the kind of people who would tell you they cant hear you because its dark outside well op  you dont really understand or have never run a business see  we have 10 lakh people coming in the cities looking for jobs every month this is from agricultural displacement + new entrants in the workforcewe fill about 5 of thatnow  we are surrounded by countries like indonesia  vietnam  bangladesh  thailand and malaysia each of them is growing yoy in manufacturing exports  women participation in workforce and gdp per capita faster than indiaalso  there is a unique situation in world trade where companies are looking to hedge their investments made in china due to a possible breakdown in trade relations with the us and chinaany company who has to invest anywhere makes an excel sheet to check probable rois and compares it with their options we had 35 taxes while every single one of these countries had 2025op thinks because there is no demand for consumption  thats why there is a slowdown but how does demand arise? do you want the government to magically gift people money? people need to work to earn and save money money for a poor country like us comes in the form of wages and salaries from manufacturing they do not come through subsidies that road leads to venezuelathis move is not about buybacks or dividends they are still taxed  unfairly  this move is about increasing the base 15 tax for new manufacturing units goes a long  long way it has never been done in india before and it needs to be applauded we dont even export as many clothes as fucking bangaldesh what the fuck are you talking about?we are not rich we are poor we need capital lots of it the us has zero  capital gains tax for foreign investors this after being the largest gdp country in the world compare our attitude when pranab mukherjee made a retrospective amendment to tax one single company after losing a case in the highest court of the country lucid op is lucidi disagree on reducing income tax as being workable in india however not enough people pay income tax or are eligible to do so doubt a reduction would make any difference since it would affect just a percentage of the middle class at this point most people earn below 25lpathe demand side issue at a larger level is not driven by taxation alone but  probably  low wages  toomanybills  debt  stagnating rural incomein my view  direct cash transfer using jam shouldve been done this aint a bizzare world  it is just late stage capitalism yeh govermint to tatti bhi prasad samajh ke khilwaayegi peoples brains have been rotted inside out by the same brainworms that affect american conservatives even if you discount the clear chain of shitty budgeting between rbi and the tax cut  what reason could possibly drive salaried workers to cheer for corporate tax cuts? they would have to be insanely gullible or incredibly misinformed to believe the moneys coming back to their pocketsim going to sound like a tinfoil lunatic when i say this  but the sheer prevalence of the procapitalist promarket narrative in india makes me think that thinktanks like orf and brookings are actively churning it out in ways that arent quite visible to me  yet  is modi our reagan? fuck people are going to be unhappy regardless  so why give a fuck bhai  in simple words you are wrong in your understandingthere are hundreds of up points of reducing corporate tax  at par with asian countries im celebrating it  but for a very different reason as i understand it  its not going to improve the governments wealth thats a good thing in my eyes  because lack of funds will keep a check on their madcap hindutva social misadventures like nrc was confused since a month wether it is a slowdown or a recession the corporate tax cut just tilted it towards a recession time to cash out and run for the hills hour will kaka get foreign funding for his party otherwise? someone has to pay fucking idiots the bunch of them and all you morons that celebrate thisnone bigger than youthese tax cuts were promised for agesthey will not only help ease the burden of the companies but theyll also aid demand owing to lower prices when the benefits are passed ondont rant just for the sake it  nobody is giving the corporates any money  they are just paying less which is good because the consumer then will pay less dont forgot the 1 billion in aid to russia corporate tax cuts are a necessary step to improve the economy  but its not the only step this is widely backed by evidence i would like to believe evidence based policies rather than mindless opposition or support  whatever may be the party,2019-09-21 06:00:53
Policy/Economy,moderate rightists vs extremist savarkarites,61,ecr1tb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ecr1tb/moderate_rightists_vs_extremist_savarkarites/,12,id identify myself as a centrist with a left inclination i swing both directions on economic and social issues  but am strongly liberal and progressive on civil liberties if someone labels me leftist  i would say  not entirely true  but sometimes im pretty leftist with being labeled socialist  i would disagree more assertively  citing my strong inclinations towards a healthy mixed economy and market driven solutions to socioeconomic problems but if i was to be labeled communist or naxalite  i would vehemently disagree im sure there are some overlaps between these ideologies and mine  but that way ill have some overlaps with almost all ideologies in the world so theres a spectrum on the left side of politics  which is well understood widely like me  most leftists dont identify with being communist or naxalitenow  right of centre politics  which is having a bit of a peak moment globally at the moment  is bound to have similar diversity and differentiation but this differentiation is not as well understood  perhaps because indian right has not been as dominant historically as it has been lately  so people havent caught up yet in case of the modishah government  a lot of people voted for them in the 2014 general elections because of the anticorruption and development narrative they campaigned with  and because of the national security issue which peaked following pulwama attack and balakot airstrikes these people may be supporters of marketdriven economic reforms  may want a break from the status quo of structural corruption in the indian state  may aspire towards a more assertive foreign policy and may desire a more proactive law and order regime these are issues which many pragmatic liberals and leftists would also support i  myself support many of this governments foreign  security and environmental policies cant say the same for this governments economic policies and civil liberties record anyone who doesnt see the plight of the indian economy is delusionalcoming back to the topic  most of the bjp voters may not support the rss agenda or consider modi an avatar of vishnu but nonetheless  in the everyday online discourse  anyone supporting modi or governments policy is labeled as modicultist  b word  or belonging to rss  s word  these terms have been misused so much that they have become meaningless  but at least  they are not as obscene as the terms that the right uses against left  this distinction between moderates and extremists on the right needs to be acknowledged and understood the extremists on the indian right subscribe to the savarkarite ideology of radical majoritarian nationalism  which they try to link with hinduism  by calling it hindutva the extremist savarkarites are the ones who indulge in conspiracy theories of global islamic takeover  and that sab mile hue hain  students  congress  aap  muslims  bollywood  global media  even pak and dawood  they act as if questioning our own government in a democracy is a crime these savarkarites are violently antigandhian  so they are ready to justify any means  as long as the ends are as per their ideology they are ok with democratic institutions being destroyed so that their leader wins   hundreds dying because of demonetisation  regular kashmiris suffering because of some extremist elements  innocent students being shot at because of vandalism done by others  and so onthis extremist faction of the right is the real danger to our nation  and to whom most liberal leftists are strongly opposed these savarkarites interpret the bjp manadate to mean that majority of the country supports their extremists views of establishment of hindu rashtra  demonization of muslims and oneparty state in india they forget that 65  of indians didnt vote for bjp  and even among the 35 that did   many dont support their extremist agenda these spontaneous  peaceful protests by lakhs of students in every single part of the country has proven that these savarkarites are delusional india is strongly pluralistic and will vehemently oppose the bigoted agenda that they subscribe to and these lakhs of protestors are more opposed to violence than these extremist savarkarites  and are heartbroken when some miscreants turn towards violence violent and extremist elements on both sides should be punished by the due process of law jai hindps those who see the world only through one lens will wonder if im a muslim i was born a hindu  but no longer identify with any religion im a proud indian though,hsnaras, someone give this man a silver right fucking now youre just clumping all right wing ideology together and calling these people sarvarkarites  which is misleading at bestif you read savarkars writings  he never conflated hinduism with hindutva as you are trying to imply savarkar was actually pretty clear that religion had nothing to do with hindutva what he described as hindutva was a homogenous cultural identity of the subcontinent according to him  which excluded the practices and traditions of abrahamic religions because he believed those were foreign influencesthis is significantly different than the rss  which is a primarily brahmin hindu organisation which believes in intra hindu fragmentation as well  in other words  they do believe in castiest principlesthings that you see nowadays such as all the cow worship and beef ban  etc would not be a thing if people were following savarkaryes  both of these are far right ideological positions and i personally do not agree with any of them and think they are harmful to the countrybut when you are talking about the ideological spectrum as you are in this post  you should recognise that the rss ideology lies even further right to that of savarkar just take  why dont you identify yourself with any religion now? the first paragraph is exactly how id describe myself too absolutely nailed it,2019-12-19 23:12:38

they blamed it on them they accused muslims of impersonating hindus to get away and practice their religion secretly this rumour became more widespread when muslims were left stateless after the national registry of citizens was introduced in 2020 so many protested  but turns out they werent enough protests werent the only thing required people needed to unbrainwashed people needed a good pair of spectacles to see clearly the hard truth was  the number of people who believed in hindutva outnumbered the others and this kept bjp in power the bjp knew  all they had to do was campaign in rural areas and brainwash the gullible in the communally unstable places in india,LovableDistributor, beautiful if anyone thinks that this just a random art of fiction then just go back 20 years behind the time and tell people that 20 years from now there will be mob lynching on the basis of people seeing cow in a vehicle and the driver is lynched back then people would have laughed at this fiction but now we know its not  fiction anymore  same goes for the above post no modi in 2038 ?anyway  it could happen  holy shit you had me in the first half i was fuming and was fearful at the same timenot sure whether modi would be around till 2038  let alone after 2024  i see shah being the pm candidate  but if we cant defeat them in 2024 election then yeah  i totally agree those days will comeedit i hadnt read the title before and thought this incident actually happened  all they had to do was campaign in rural areas and brainwash the gullible in the communally unstable places in indiai would like to read something on how bjp  +other rw  is more powerful in rural areas over urban areas,2019-12-22 12:13:19

id give my answer to this because i am one of the few people who understand these issuesbecause i have power to solve one of these issues atleast to a tiny extentbecause india sucking is as much a fault of the knowledged staying silent as that of the stupid ruling the roost bollywood answer alert  because it is my place how many ever years i stay in any country  i wouldnt be considered as a localite i wouldnt be able to say that this is my country you said you are 28 and you have been in germany for 8+ years  did you go there for your bachelors degree? if yes  was the education free for bachelors? also  why doesnt germany have a provision that parents of german immigrant  citizens can also get german citizenship  like canada?also  how is the treatment of muslims in germany  cause i heard the right wing is getting stronger there? re indian mangoes banned  it  was eu wide  https  wwwlivemintcom politics fmxwwnq0zcl5zjvaogyhgi euagreestoliftimportbanonalphonsomangoeshtml  there was also a ban on some vegetables which remained in place same reason too much pesticidethere have been similar alerts in  the uae  https  wwwthenationalae uae uaealertoverpesticidesinfoodfromindia1191984  and even the indian press has  published stories  https  timesofindiaindiatimescom city hyderabad chemicalconcoctionpesticidesinveggiesandfruitsharmhyderabadchildren articleshow 65126763cms  about it indians feel like people owe something to you indians take things personally like a comment here  a service would be considered as help and refused when a service is refused  you know what it means fortunately  a service isnt interpreted as help and thus not refused  as much as it is in india  abroad ive noticed this and thats just my two cents the mentality of the people should change hyderabad doesnt have gez fee  germany has  nice post and agree with you currently living in south east asia and i always want to move to europe because of various reasons but the salaries and the taxes always make me think interesting read  opi am curious  what is the status of racism against brown people in germany considering the fact that theres been a sudden inflow in refugees over the past two years? also  how long did it take you to get fluent in german?  deleted  hi as someone living in germany for quite some while and familiar other parts of europe as well  which countries do you see having well established or a booming it tech industry at the moment in the near future? also  in terms of quality of life  ease of integration emigration  and racial attitudes  and in general the culture how would you rank these countries?asking because im looking at emigrating to europe as an option and would love to know your perspective ok  it seems like youre having a really good time in germany and your quality of life is extremely well im happy for you for that youve risen out of the struggles of india and found some peace and breathing room in a more stable place good for you i mean thatnow  is it possible for you to return to hyderabad permanently and still find a way to sustain yourself and those that depend on you financially? considering youre a techie  there is a good  enough  market for software developers here so i think that is possible if so  what is stopping you from doing that?the reason im asking this is because you seem like an above average and sharp person youve also had experience abroad which a lot of people do not have here with all that in mind  your perspective and passion will be invaluable and the same goes for your siblings if youre this passionate about your country while staying abroad  imagine what you could do for your country  your city or even just your locality if you were living here? so why arent you here?one reason could be that you really arent financially stable enough to shift here  and thats ok if thats not the case then the only reason left is that your passion is misplaced you are only worrying about your home because you feel like you should or because you have family living there when in reality youve subconsciously accepted your new home in germany its either that or something else that explains why youre not in india trying to help with these problems youve mentionedsee  all im hearing from your post is please make the city more livable a plea coming from a nonresident indian who will never go through the difficulties of achieving that goal  because he doesnt and wont live here  but expects the locals to do so and inshallah we will do so  but not to set up cushions for you but to furnish our own citiesyour post implies that us citizens are wilfully producing and promoting this black  shitty air that you mention when in fact  just in case you didnt know  we dont want this air just as much as you  actually  we dont want it more than you because we have to breathe it every day  this  if nothing else  keeps us motivated to change that and since we are living here we can directly try to change thatso you can see why a rant about our shitty cities can sound hypocritical to our ears when were trying to fix things here and someone who has just about none of a dog left in the race tells us to make the city more livable it sounds very condescending  like a rich merchant asking the poor peasants to hurry up and stop being poorwere trying and when i say you in this post i mean to point to every nri that rants about the situation in india but hasnt contributed to anything significant to help with it  do i miss it? nah do i miss the culture? absolutely yes do i want to come back and live there? nopei dont know why i wrote all this youve said it yourself  you only want the good parts without having to have worked to remove the bad partsalso  i dont know why youre worried about coming to hyderabad as a muslim im not the most politically educated but even i can tell you that hyderabad is possibly the safest place for an indian muslim to live in  particularly a hyderabadi muslim  if you dont believe that then either im wrong or youve just proven how outoftouch you are with your culture   u ppcontentrobot  https  wwwredditcom user ppcontentrobot    i wouldnt disagree with anything you are pitch perfect on whats wrong in the country and i wouldnt blame you for choosing a better quality of lifei wish i could just raise a wand and change the way things work in our country but unfortunately i just cant so  i came down here and asked the world whats wrong and how we can influence change? jingle bells  i wasnt cut out for what came backif there is one thing i am sure of  it is of the fact that we just cant keep doing this forever things around emigration will change drastically in the next decade and it will no longer be cut out for everyone i wish we dont have to wait till we get hit to reform change but you will always be a foreigner there and never feel truly part of the country  despite having citizenship  not to mention the huge rise in antiimmigrant sentiments in europe  which although brought about by mass immigration from syria and africa  will also threaten to sweep up welleducated foreigners like youthe sad truth is india is destined for mediocrity  democracy is holding it back as it is susceptible to votebank  politics and nothing ever gets donechina also has lots of different ethnic minorities  although not as many as india  and the reason they managed to do so well was because of an authoritarian leadership indias inability to get a grip with the population explosion is contributing to much of this misery we will have the same population as china by 2024 despite only having 1 3 the land mass  we are extremely polluted due to this population density and it is said there will be a major water crisis in the futuremore than 50 of our population is in agriculture  this is completely unacceptable and farming should have been heavily mechanised by now and the people moved to manufacturing or something like thatall this because crap politicians will keep their grip on power by gaining the votes of uneducated lower castes who can easily be convinced the smart indians will always view going abroad as the ultimate dream because they know india is beyond saving its easy to avoid dirt and walk away but it takes guts to step into the mess and clean it but can you get chai from a tapari in germany? from my experiences in europe and latin america  i prefer a life in india yes  it has its hassles  but everything is pretty accessible here  and affordable to everyone i am not denying the downsides  but i would like to list out something that we want to overlook for greener pastures  nothing to boast  but i find the holiday structure of govt opportunities here pretty neat and more public holidays private sector sucks  yes i can travel 29 states  as diverse as schengen nations just pack your bags and hop in a bus or train you dont even need a car  even to go to the remotest part no need for any language certificate to be anywhere or work anywhere  free movement i dont know whether i would want to be another citizen i dont know about as many  but its pretty neat here too yup  no paternity leave here exists here too children can play with other children  and go to good schools as well might not be as extensive as there in curriculum  yes i think you pay much more tax too  for social security  but way def a positive not great at infrastructure  but hospital and care are def good in my statethe only place i felt like settling in was urban brazil felt like a dev version of india with the most diverse and welcoming people i have ever met very interesting responseits your choice as to where you want to stay  hyderabad versus germany  but i want to ask1 what are the laws about spitting and littering in germany? did you educate your family and friends in hyderabad about them?2 can you have religious functions in germany shouting slogans in the street?3 can a mosque have loudspeakers blaring azaan 5 times a day? can you set up a slaughterhouse on eid and slaughter goats in the name of religion in germany?4 can you stand and say i am an immigrant and a muslim in germany?5 did you know that the pollution you are complaing about comes from vehicles and people attempt to pay bribes to get puc certificates?

Policy/Economy,i read the indian economic survey of 20189 so you didnt have to here are the highlights,100,c95ykl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c95ykl/i_read_the_indian_economic_survey_of_20189_so_you/,46,the biggest takeaway was the direct attack on what the survey calls anglosaxon economics basically the concept of a general equilibrium theory instead it claims an economy is always within either a virtous cycle or a vicious cycle a virtous cycle is characterised by rising investment  rising exports and rising savings a vicious cycle is the inverse of that the implication is that the government must intervene to steady the ship and any fantasy about rational actors has to be abandonedthe importance of higher savings cannot be underestimated accoring to the survey it is only with high and rising savings that a country can selffinance high investments otherwise it must seek out foreign savings which gets translated into a high current account deficit which in turn makes it vulnerable during times of crises they survey continually made mention of china and other fastgrowing east asian economies when making its case in countless graphs it is clear what the chief inspiration is having very high savings naturally means having a correspondingly low domestic consumption thus  the only way to have fast growth when domestic consumption is subdued is through fast export growth they survey made the case that because india still has a low share of world export market so there is plenty of scope to regain  regardless of trade tensionsthe survey made many other recommendations  of which judicial reform is one which caught my one  but the overriding theme of the survey was the call to abandon anglosaxon economics  by which it meant general equilibrium theory itll be interesting to see if india truly makes a decisive economic policy break from the past as the language suggests,MelodicBerries, based on your summary   and good of you to make the effort  the economic survey is goobleydook if theyre busy saying general equilibrium theory is anglo saxon economics  and somehow behavioral stuff is not?  then its some weird waste of time in the you arent even wrong kind of badim going to go read it now one else has to waste their time on this shit literally  r badeconomics thank you for your service to the nation one of the worst economic surveys ever in the recent years it was expected  given how the current cea got his job https  enwikipediaorg wiki krishnamurthy_subramanian#careerin articles published in the times of india and livemint titled  will black be back? why demonetisation will be revolutionary in indias fight against corruption  and demonetisation are the poor really suffering?  respectively  subramanian supported the government of indias banknote demonetisation policy in 2016 what didnt catch your eye1 nudge economics and excessive stress on behavioural economics  it seems like a kind of foreshadowing and a prelude to excuses for data theft2 after speaking few pages on gibberish on big data and data  the govt reiterates the same lines as it did before aadhar judgment sovereignty of data  state security and providing cheap data to corporates while again  using the garb of security and ease of biz3 all the wanking on beti bachao beti padhao being an immense success and swacchh bharat being a great success sorry to let you know  the chapters seemed kind of promotion than anything related to policy prescription thats quite a downgrade  even under ndas standards  given i havent missed an es since 20144 for all the bashing of anglo saxon economics do yourself a favor pick up es 2018  book 1 see chapter 1 or chapter 2  basically the big chapter  in one of the boxes  where it compares to usa and then later in another of the chapters  where it compares savings and investment slowdowns across economies  it shamelessly uses rodriks theory and proves  india shouldnt give a damn about savings rate this time it did a 180  bro thank you for the effort you missed out the nudge the mass control program they are gonna make robots out of people for the first time ever  a government has openly admitted to using behavioral control just imagine the consequences of it as used in electoral politics thank you can you please eli5 general equilibrium theory? i am little concern about mutual alienation between india and russia and in return uss backstabbing theoretically uschinas trade war should benefit india  but by the way us has treated us in the previous term i am not sure high quality stuff thanks  deleted  so is this a major policy break then? is india ditching free market economics for some sort of a social democracy  eg  like the nordic model  or are we adapting the managedeconomy model of china? could someone explain exactly what nudges the govt is implementing?ive read the book called nudge by thaler it could be a good thing if done right or it could be orwellian if done wrong,2019-07-05 07:59:05
Policy/Economy,the purpose of war  1984   george orwell,34,ehjlce,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ehjlce/the_purpose_of_war_1984_george_orwell/,4,the primary aim of modern warfare is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living ever since the end of the nineteenth century  the problem of what to do with the surplus of consumption goods has been latent in industrial society from the moment when the machine first made its appearance it was clear to all thinking people that the need for human drudgery  and therefore to a great extent for human inequality  had disappeared if the machine were used deliberately for that end  hunger  overwork  dirt  illiteracy  and disease could be eliminated within a few generations and in fact  without being used for any such purpose  but by a sort of automatic process  by producing wealth which it was sometimes impossible not to distribute  the machine did raise the living standards of the average humand being very greatly over a period of about fifty years at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries but it was also clear that an allround increase in wealth threatened the destruction  indeed  in some sense was the destruction  of a hierarchical society in a world in which everyone worked short hours  had enough to eat  lived in a house with a bathroom and a refrigerator  and possessed a motorcar or even an aeroplane  the most obvious and perhaps the most important form of inequality would already have disappeared if it once became general  wealth would confer no distinction it was possible  no doubt  to imagine a society in which wealth  in the sense of personal possessions and luxuries  should be evenly distributed  while power remained in the hands of a small privileged caste but in practice such a society could not long remain stable for if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike  the great mass of human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for themselves  and when once they had done this  they would sooner or later realize that the privileged minority had no function  and they would sweep it away in the long run  a hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignoranceto return to the agricultural past  as some thinkers about the beginning of the twentieth century dreamed of doing  was not a practicable solution it conflicted with the tendency towards mechanization which had become quasiinstinctive throughout almost the whole world  and moreover  any country which remained industrially backward was helpless in a military sense and was bound to be dominated  directly or indirectly  by its more advanced rivals nor was it a satisfactory solution to keep the masses in poverty by restricting the output of goods this happened to a great extent during the final phase of capitalism  roughly between 1920 and 1940 the economy of many countries was allowed to stagnate  land went out of cultivation  capital equipment was not added to  great blocks of the population were prevented from working and kept half alive by state charity but this  too  entailed military weakness  and since the privations it inflicted were obviously unnecessary  it made opposition inevitable the problem was how to keep the wheels of industry turning without increasing the real wealth of the world goods must be produced  but they must not be distributed and in practice the only way of achieving this was by continuous warfare the essential act of war is destruction  not necessarily of human lives  but of the products of human labour war is a way of shattering to pieces  or pouring into the stratosphere  or sinking in the depths of the sea  materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable  and hence  in the long run  too intelligent even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed  their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed a floating fortress  for example  has locked up in it the labour that would build several hundred cargoships ultimately it is scrapped as obsolete  never having brought any material benefit to anybody  and with further enormous labours another floating fortress is builtin principle the war effort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus that might exist after meeting the bare needs of the population in practice the needs of the population are always underestimated  with the result that there is a chronic shortage of half the necessities of life  but this is looked on as an advantage it is deliberate policy to keep even the favoured groups somewhere near the brink of hardship  because a general state of scarcity increases the importance of small privileges and thus magnifies the distinction between one group and another by the standards of the early twentieth century  even a member of the inner party lives an austere  laborious kind of life nevertheless  the few luxuries that he does enjoy his large  wellappointed flat  the better texture of his clothes  the better quality of his food and drink and tobacco  his two or three servants  his private motorcar or helicopterset him in a different world from a member of the outer party  and the members of the outer party have a similar advantage in comparison with the submerged masses whom we call the proles the social atmosphere is that of a besieged city  where the possession of a lump of horseflesh makes the difference between wealth and poverty and at the same timethe consciousness of being at war  and therefore in danger  makes the handingover of all power to a small caste seem the natural  unavoidable condition of survival,Istradefylline, everyone should read this just mesmerizing i am speechless with the absolutely to the point logical flow of the events causes never ever thought this never knew war had an economic purpose of social control orwell  thank you,2019-12-30 22:15:00

Policy/Economy,the true purpose of reservations in india is not economic upliftment  but social inclusion,133,d6vb4b,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d6vb4b/the_true_purpose_of_reservations_in_india_is_not/,54, for the record  i am a brahmin  i dont see myself as one it is merely the word that i use when i fill out any government form that asks me the question  and i have  in no way  benefited from reservations or affirmative actionreservations in india is a fraught topic and tends to divide people like no other topic does the vast majority of the upper castes blame reservations for indias inefficient governance and subsequent lack of opportunities many others think it is meant to provide economic upliftment to the socalled depressed classes who have been at the receiving end of the caste pyramid for centuries others describe it as a necessary evil that does more good than harm i take objection to this description of reservation as a necessary evil and as a means of economic upliftment it is not evil and it is necessary it does not seek to economically uplift the depressed classes i will now demonstrate whyreservations for the depressed classes  scheduled castes or scheduled tribes and so on and so forth  have been a feature of politics  education and employment opportunities in independent india the policy aims to reserve a portion of seats in educational institutions  employment opportunities in government run organisations and in electoral constituencies for those candidates who are identified to be part of the above mentioned communities these communities have historically been marginalised and have been downtrodden for millennia in the case of the scheduled tribes  or sts   their predilection to residing in the forests and the remote hinterlands of the indian sub continent has ensured that they remained outside the purview of mainstream society and thus bereft of the opportunities that are provided by being part of the villages and cities and so on the tribes of india are for the most part  hunter gatherers living in the remote jungle  such as the bhils  gonds and santhals   or nomadic herders in nature  living with their livestock and migrating from one place to another in search of pasture  such as the gujjars in some states  though their status as an st is debatable  many of these tribes lived only on the margins of human settlements in india and were viewed with hostility and suspicion by most people the british criminalised many of them by instituting an act called the criminal tribes act entire communities were criminalised and those who were on the margins of society were further outcast these communities neither had a say nor were given any kind of justice when their resources  such as forest produce  or land that has historically belonged to them  were extracted  or plundered  if you think that way  by the government of india in the name of the people of india their woman and children have been exploited when they venture out of their remote domains they have forever been on the margins of society  physically and socially  and have had no voice in the debates of modern india  a country that now counts them as its citizensthe scheduled castes  or scs  have been treated worse these communities were classified as social outcasts and were often forced to live outside the village they werent allowed to draw water from the same well as the rest of the village  they werent allowed to visit the temple or take part in the communal activities such as festivals or decision making they provided an important source of agricultural labour in villages  and still do  and performed menial jobs in the cities that were ritually considered impure or dirty the agricultural economy would collapse if their labour was not available and sanitation would have been nonexistent in the cities without the dalits to clean the toilets and clear the corpses and yet  they were not part of the conversation when it came to society they have never had a voice  a say in the decisions that are made when the community gets together and makes a collective decision they have been exploited physically  economically  and socially by all and sundry their status has been little better than slaves they are an important part of indian society but have little to no say in the affairs of the country or the state  and yet they are counted as citizens of indiawhy am i telling you so much about how these communities have been excluded over thousands of years? because reservation is not a policy that primarily seeks to economically uplift communities and give them education and jobs the purpose of reservation is not economic upliftment but social inclusion within the mainstream of society  in effect giving them a say in governance and a voice in society reservation aims to bring these communities into the social mainstream so that they become part of the conversation and are able to participate fully in society  in politics  in our educational institutions  in employment  in decision making capacities and so on  without affirmative action policies such as reservation  these communities will forever be marginalised on the outskirts of society they will be denied a voice and denied opportunities to advance  and denied the right to be treated with dignity as humans the harm done to these communities by centuries of prejudice has hardly begun to be redressed by the policies of independent india it is highly unfortunate that the original purpose of reservation has been warped in such a manner that all and sundry  i am looking at the obcs and those who advocate reservations for economically weaker sections among the upper castes now  are demanding reservations reservation is not about economic opportunity it is about social justice  and economic opportunity is a by product of social opportunity until such a time arrives when these communities are afforded the same social opportunities as the rest of society and are not excluded  reservations are a necessity in india it is not a necessary evil it is not an evil at all it is justice,conqueror_of_destiny, do you think it is working? what i see is that even otherwise reasonable people get angay and resentful when they talk about reservation i personally know a few people who talks about sc st people in extremely bad manner they werent like this before entrance examinations after 12th now  whenever we discuss about writing psc examinations  they are like enthina? kanda polyadikku okke kittum nammalu ezhuthiyikk karyamilla meaning for what? only low caste people expletive  will benefit from such examinations and we wont get any benefitanother thing i have noticed is that these same people are getting more crazy about religion  especially hindus they feel that there is no one else to support them so  reservations dont reinforce already existing caste distinctions in society? economic based scholarships would go a long way in alleviating this rather than reservation in jobsonce you have education in your mind  you get a certain level of selfawareness and selfrespect  the scheduled castes  or scs  have been treated worse these communities were classified as social outcasts and were often forced to live outside the village they werent allowed to draw water from the same well as the rest of the village  they werent allowed to visit the temple or take part in the communal activities such as festivals or decision making they provided an important source of agricultural labour in villages  and still do  and performed menial jobs in the cities that were ritually considered impure or dirty the agricultural economy would collapse if their labour was not available and sanitation would have been nonexistent in the cities without the dalits to clean the toilets and clear the corpses and yet  they were not part of the conversation when it came to society they have never had a voice  a say in the decisions that are made when the community gets together and makes a collective decision they have been exploited physically  economically  and socially by all and sundry their status has been little better than slaves they are an important part of indian society but have little to no say in the affairs of the country or the state  and yet they are counted as citizens of indiaok  im a dalit ive trying to learn about the history of dalits for a long time although what youve written seems like the dominant narrative i think the truth could be much more sinister in tn  where i live  the dalit communities in ancient times still lived outside these agricultural societies but there are several cultural practices  that would turn the idea that dalits were looked down upon several rituals in marriages and temple functions etc have a respectable role for members of these castes and receive their blessings some temple festivals start with the first ritual being performed from by a member of pariayar community then theres that sangam poetry which puts the paraiyar community as one of the noble communities so there is a lot we are missing herebut looking at the recent ydna results and the cultural practices of the past its possible there was a shift in religious practices that resulted in the dehumanization of dalits dalits are most likely the descendants of the tribals that lived in the periphery of the cities they lived in separate settlements because they are culturally huntergatherers and there definitely was some mixing in the absence of a caste system and they lived peacefully becacuse the post ivc agricultural societies knew they are descended from huntergatherer societies themselves and had huntergatherer gods such as sivan and murugan the shift is the sanskritisation of tamil culture with the arrival of more vedicleaning brahmins i think there were other brahmins before who had integrated with tamil culture and were okay with adopting local traditions this could be one of the cause for the schisms that exist between iyers and iyengars in tn  the beginning of the caste system and sanskritization of tn culture would have pushed dalits outside tamil society in a power struggle for the cultural space of the tamils with the brahmins winning today there are still remnants of this struggle lot of old kula deivam temples employ dalits as the priests out of tradition so yea  in the last 1500 years condition of dalits have deteriorated to that of slaves it just wasnt always like that im a brahmin too and yes i am not against the reservation but against the efficiency of reservation  my family was extremely poor and my father used to pull rickshaw and worked in a hotel   included cleaning hotels toilet about 10 years ago  while ive seen abject poverty and with a family of five hardly managing food in urban areas most of upper caste are never different from any other poor  even back in our village the situations have changed with hardly any opportunity  left there was no government scheme that would help us thats not just us but most of the relatives back  in the rural areabefore giving my aieee and making it to an nit  i didnt hardly ate anything for 2 days but wateri remember my first day of college  where my room mate whose father had association with bamcef and grilled me for 15 minutes  as if i was going to discriminate his son ultimately he became a good friend despite his father brainwashing him when we parted from the college  to an extent that he admitted and hated the reservation system himself through years  he came to know about the fact that poverty strikes both dalits and upper caste the same way atleast in urban areas dalits in rural areas no doubt have it worse  and even in urban areas there is discrimination but its certainly decreasing his father was a professor in known college of up  and he had a relatively cushioned life right now there is a generation of dalits which has reaped benefits of reservation and are not willing to leave the same for the needs of the others#x200b without affirmative action policies such as reservation  these communities will forever be marginalised on the outskirts of society they will be denied a voice and denied opportunities to advance  and denied the right to be treated with dignity as humans the harm done to these communities by centuries of prejudice has hardly begun to be redressed by the policies of independent indiado you think the current reservation system will ever take out these communities from poverty ? there are millions of dalits in rural areas who will remain where they are because group of  elite dalits of urban areas will keep reaping the benefits in a cycle#x200b the harm done to these communities by centuries of prejudice has hardly begun to be redressed by the policies of independent indiaif after 70 years of independence  if these efforts have hardly improved anything then dont you think there is something wrong with the reservation policies ?  by the current pace of improvements in life of rural dalits who are real victim  its going to take 1000s of years back in the village a dalit family still faces a lot of discrimination  the situation in urban areas have improved compared to that the reservation should preferably be given rural dalits and then anyone else i dont understand your blanket statement  a lot of communities within dalits are now very rich and powerful  if we dont change the system this will be just another caste system#x200b reservation is not about economic opportunity it is about social justice  and economic opportunity is a by product of social opportunity until such a time arrives when these communities are afforded the same social opportunities as the rest of society and are not excludedi lost my mother to cancer 6 years ago  a lot of poor people do we didnt had money to get her treated in a good hospital certainly again government wont help us under nhp schemes the budget were allocated for sc st some of them being not utilised we wrote to countless bureaucratic structure to help us  so that we could use the same under as we were economically poor but we couldnt she died in extreme sufferings is this the social justice that you are talking about ?reservation system in india is deeply flawed and its time we start talking about it#x200b you write very nice things  but i dont think youve seen the poverty as a upper class poor or even dalit for that matter ask them and they would any day leave their caste   creed   religion and be whatever you ask them to be  u conqueror_of_destiny while i agree with most of your text  the aim of affirmative action is not social equality inclusion  but equal representation aa does not aim to remove discrimination  but to provide representation to those who have been historically oppressedantidiscrimination laws exist to ensure social equality  while social schemes exist for economic equality paisa hai to status hai bhai agar paisa hai to untouchable also becomes a valued best friend you brag about yeah its sad and funny that a lot of people nowadays think the main problem with caste system is reservation and the small minority that abuses it i agree to you but none of these reason justifies reservation to person who belongs to family of a civil servant  doctor  rich bushiness man   economically strong  families until such a time arrives when these communities are afforded the same social opportunities as the rest of society and are not excluded  reservations are a necessity in india#x200b 1 how do you measure social opportunity?2 do you believe obc reservations  are a evilnecessary evil or are they justice?3 why do you believe justice against those not guilty of discrimination is not evil? 4 what social opportunities are available to a lower middle class jatkshatriya that are not available to a sr level sc govt employees kid and how does an iit reserved seat help the kid get those? correct me if im wrong but wasnt the original purpose of reservation to uplift minorities in a certain amount of years and then remove it when equality  economically and socially  for all people is reached but then every politician decided to just use it for votes instead of actually uplifting the minorities truth is their are not much gov jobs compared to increasing population of india reservation in job doesnt matter muchsecondly talking about merit based admission in colleges their are not much good quality of institute apart from iims and iits and few other  and iits are also not that extraordinary so proreservation lobby must understand that all students from sc st obc generally are less talented than 50 of the class and it is very likely they will remain below avrg in their batch only top 5 or 10 are winners at the end of 3 4 years degree and people against reservation complaining sc st obc stealing their seats they need to under that even reservation is removed u wont amount much i see whole reservation thing as dividing india more than actually helping sc st obc  their was a reason ambedkar did not want reservation forever  disclaimer i am gujju bania who passed 12th science on 6th attempt  never went to college  ran family bness and now am mining bitcoin at iceland i dont complain about anything and i get what i want thank you for writing this also want to add how oblivious most of us are about the casual discrimination that happens around us its almost embedded in our culture i recently went home and heard two phrases  that i had been hearing forever   but their connotation dawned on me just recently basically they were like what you acting like an xyz caste  meaning  you are being dirty or messy like a person from the said caste second was like you are looking like an xyz  meaning you are looking dirty and unkempt  again like a person from the said caste  needless to say the said caste fall under sc these are phrases very commonly used  at least in my hometown  the person using this isnt really a bad mean casteist person it was just so integrated in the whole culture that even though the phrases are outright derogatory  they are just normalised the discrimination is just so normalised why not both? we want reservations for poor dalits look up nietzsches notions of master and slave morality and the concept of ressentiment perfect comment man  or woman  its a shame that so few of the anti reservation people even know of the fact that its not meant to be a poverty alleviation scheme it was always about social inclusion and for all its faults  real or perceived  it has performed decently at this theres a reasonable case to be made for more subdivisions in the quotas though there is class within caste as well for eg the meena caste is more educated and powerful than the other sc castes most of the benefits are cornered by them leaving the other people in the same state they were in before such type of reforms and a creamy layer exclusion can be thought of the creamy layer will not be based on the logic that economic upliftment finishes social discrimination but on the logic that the benefits of reservation should percolate more freely among the deserving thank you  you have done a good job but its not easy for everyone to look at this in a nonemotional way or rational way  i kind of agree to the other side of the argument too  reservation does causes some more division and anger  being from a obc and not using any kind of reservation till datebut im more in support for reservations than against it agreed some of the other developed more sucessful countries that have reservation that i know of  china  usa  japan there are probably more i belong to a lower middle class sc family two of my cousins who got high paying govt jobs  wanted to marry their respective gfs  both of whom was from higher castes both the girls parents said the same thing  that their community wont accept them after they have married their girl to a boy from lower caste one of girls family were from delhi  so its not even a small town problemi dont see caste system being eradicated from most of the country for another 3050 years i know people who got 3rd division in ssc and isnt capable of clearing an entrance even if you give him the question paper a month in advance complaining that he couldnt get in because of reservationno  son you didnt get in because you are a fucking moron,2019-09-21 03:28:55

wasting all that food on these poor people when we can use it for our own amusement like we could use it to make a sport where we throw it into a river or something  or just put all that on the ground  and dance on it  maximizing enjoyment factor all that billions of dollars wasted on social welfare and infrastructure for these people  instead the boring shitshow that is where we have to watch these people slowly starve to death  we could use the same to build thunderdomes and arenas where we make them fight for a fistfull of food  but then kill them anyway instead of wasting all this electricity and technology  to apparently elevate these people  you know what we can do? giant machines machines that can use these people as fuel like in matrix  we can just hook these people as soon as they are born in to these machines with a very thick chord that connects them to the machine through their ass we hook these people upside down inside these giant machines and mine cryptocurrencies from their butts think about it  we can use this butt currency to improve our economy  place bets in the death matches etc our country is going to be a 5 trillion dollar economy in a few months  imagine if only the select few of us could enjoy all of that we we could be like a self sustaining switzerland backed by ass crypto i mean seriously think about this  it is a much more humane way of living for these people over whatever the shit quality of life they have nowjust my two cents join me in supporting for a humane and prosperous india  lets get rid of poverty and illiteracy by locking up the pooronly poor illiterates count,Rocky_since1951, apparently  30 of the population is below poverty line that is they live by dollar a day a lot of time we dont see them because we live in a bubble your security guards and waiters mostly come from bihar and ne and there are much lesser jobs our countrymen do its the middle class that is getting the d in india was that an attempt at mocking the underprivileged?  lets get rid of poverty and illiteracy by locking up the poor    only poor illiterates count our country is going to be a 5 trillion dollar economy in a few monthswrong factjust get one thing straight  it doesnt matter however targeted programmes you run  there is only one way to remove poverty  that is is rapid economic growth rising tide lifts all boats you may not want it but the country needs 10 more mukesh ambanis so that they can employ millions and thus there is some hope for some people just see chinese example  they didnt care about people opinions  they picked them from villages  provided them jobs  housing  medical and thus created chain of people coming out of abject povertythough i am well aware this cant be implemented in india  deleted  hi so i feel the same way you cant really change generations of class divide  however change yourselftreat everyone with respect i say thank you and sorry to watchmen  chefs and walters and try not to disturb them too much just be kind and understanding to all try not to dress too fancy all the time remember the zeros on the left side of your net worth matter alot  but after a while the zeros on the right and side matter less try to live a humble life never waste food or try to do so if possible try to use public transport and just be nice person who doesnt show off his or her money or parents money just dont give money in charity  but time also by volunteering for a cause you think you are good at you dont know how many lives you cand drastically improve indirectly i get confused with the term poor people offlate at least  majority of those who qualify under the poor people category in cities dont really fall under this group as they earn really well  but in unaccountable ways aka without any taxation how they spend their money is a different matter though most of these poor people earn a hand full in cities or dont earn because they are lazy  and not because of lack of opportunities  i feel every time i get exploited by these poor people rather than i exploiting them  it starts with almost everyone who fall into this bpl category and they will try to extract as much as possible from you or cheat you or want to get away with half baked work take your maid  auto driver  road sweeper  vegetable seller  construction worker  etc etc etc just this evening  i am fooled with poor quality apples in spite of paying the amount he asked for it ps i am specifically referring to these fake poor people in cities and not the real poor  mostly outside big cities  towns  who struggle to meet ends inspite of hard work,2019-11-29 20:33:07
Policy/Economy, rant  indias brutal tax for the rich,227,ch4zwd,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ch4zwd/rant_indias_brutal_tax_for_the_rich/,201,to be honest  i feel this post applies to those who pay tax  regardless of which slab   im just putting stuff from my perspectivethere are no two ways to put it  indias tax on the super rich is ridiculously high i belong to that super rich community and while paying taxes is not an issue  the amount certainly is money doesnt come easy and ive worked hard for it meanwhile the government just gives us a big middle finger and increases the taxes now tell me why would anyone want to live in a developing country with such high tax rates before any of youll hark on about patriotism and bullshit like that just think logically for a second for the amount of tax  427  paid here  you can easily shift to a country with lower tax rates and with the kind of money people from my income category have i can see a lot of them leaving this country for good the government is not incentivizing individuals to become wealthy what benefits does being wealthy in india get you? roads are shit  public infrastructure is lacking  incredibly high taxes for luxury items  the list goes on and on instead they want to spend my money on statues  stupid ministries like ayush  scams  bailing out public sector companies and stuff like thatworse  so much money  which i gave as tax is being spent to appease the vote bank rich farmers are not taxed because the government is afraid to lose them the individuals and companies who pay taxes  the 1  have absolutely no say in policies because the government wants to use the money to appease the other  99   the figures are just examples  we are the source of that money india is taking a turn to the socialist era  when taxes were even more exorbitant and india was a planned economy i just wish the government would aggressively try to increase the tax base instead of strangling those who pay taxedit i am not averse to paying high taxes in general i already elaborated that in my comment below but in india  tax does not give benefits that other countries with similar tax rates give,billionaireinindia, at what level of income does 42 tax come in? so apparently there are only 5000 such people with such high income and so the impact on the country is marginal this exactly is why this form of taxation is bullshit there are way more than 5000 people earning 2 crore and above in indiaall the rest not only evade taxes  they also are contributing to the black economy beause they will be penalized otherwise if india has to mop up tax revenue  we need to stop treating rich people as criminals and make it easier for them to consume more and tax that consumption i  for one  am for higher taxation for the superrich but where i am in total agreement with you is what the money is being used for if it was for developing the nation and social welfare schemes i am all for it  but right now it just lines the pockets of politicians and gives out doles to the vote banks this sucks i dont want to pay taxes to make someone else rich or to help someone be in power#x200b if you want to move abroad  most  developed  countries have a higher rate of taxation than us but of course  in most of those cases the taxes are put in to better use this wikipedia list  https  enwikipediaorg wiki list_of_countries_by_tax_rates  compares taxation rates between countries  and youll see most european countries have a very high tax rate it can go upto 60 in scandinavian countries  but then again  in those countries you dont have to pay for education or healthcare in us  the highest tax rate is 505 and in canada 54  in nova scotia  even nepal has a 50 income tax for the superrich btw  im curious why you dont buy a us green card though? under eb5  i think they require 34 crore invested and even if invested via brokers and so on ive heard you get most of it back after 5 years you  my friend  may be an exception i agree with your points the quality of life is atrocious  high pollution levels   increasing crime   shabby infrastructure and subsidies for everyone apart from the honest tax payers   white income   if you have the means look at us or canada and get an oci card i know a lot of people who took eb5 visa to us and escaped the drudgery of life in india if you belong to a super rich community  you should be getting tfo of the country which is what thousands of french  millionaires did when france passed a ridiculous wealth tax law the smart superrich indians seem to have got the message toostunningly  india in 2017 suffered a net loss of 7 000 members  or 2 percent  of its millionaire population https  wwwnytimescom 2018 06 02 opinion sunday millionairesfleeingmigrationhtmlyou cant fight an economically illiterate government  which is rewarded by the electorate with crushing margins of victory despite its economically insane policies  see demonetization   expect this pattern  crazy economic policies  military adventures to whip up patriotism  religious rabble rousing etc   to repeat when the next elections come around in 2024  if i were you  id be long gone to a country where  at the least those kinds of high taxes would at least get me something in returnps if you are really super rich  and not trolling us    and dont plan to leave  maybe you can help some fellow randians gtfo? thanks in advance    why are you living in india? cattle class here and i completely agree with you the budget was a total disappointment a majority govt is of no use if it cannot take difficult steps india need to grow faster and we need rich hardworking smart people to do that farmers are glorified  the subsidies are the reason why loss making farms continue to work  there is no consolidation of farm lands even after 70 years  consolidated farmlands are necessary for large scale mechanisation and higher productivity level in agricultureconsolidation of farmland will provide necessary cheap labor at factories which will attract foreign capital till the time foreign investments arrive govt should utilise this cheap labor for large infrastructure projectsbut fuck it all  loot the rich hardworking class and feed the poor there is no point saying such reasonable things in india people here want even moderately successful people to be double and triple taxed on the same income and support giving freebies to farmers  even if it means our public discoms go into debt and cant distribute electricity efficiently  or urban citizens suffer from a drought because 80 of a reservoirs water has been diverted to appease rich farmers who lobby the government people even on this thread are calling for even more welfare spending  without even realizing that the cumulative effect of welfare spending every year is the reason we have less to invest in infrastructure than east asian nations the government will laugh at you  swindle you  demean your education and achievements and harrass you or libel you to gain votes  and then cozy up to you if youre successful 70+ years after independence and our financial capital floods every year  illiteracy is still high  the trains are miserable compared to those in europe  flat  even roads are a rarity and corruption is still skyhigh there are encouraging signs  but god this country takes great effort to make sure everyone everywhere is miserable our tax is marginal tax that means entire income isnt taxed at 30 only the value which goes above the slab a certain  of total income as tax to everyone seems plausible it true what he said   rich farmers are not taxed much i have seen farmers taking advantage of karj maafi to buy a nice cars i used to complain about this when i used to live in india and i used to be in top slab but the income inequality in india is extreme if you live in middle class bubble  its very easy to forget how widespread poverty is in india the wealth gap you see between even a middle class white collar guy and a minimum wage service job guy is insane here theres no way india can provide the same services as developed countries with so much poverty its just not going to happen  as we really need the money to develop and maintain our vast rural country they really need their development a lot more than our services  and thats the harsh reality our roads in cities might be crowded and in bad state  but they dont even have enough schools and health facilities there are no jobs in rural area  farmers are committing suicides as a part of same country  we all contribute to the government in taxes who then has to prioritize who and where its required we have obvious issues with random waste and stupid vanity projects  but you cannot treat tax as something which only you should see the entire benefit of you are subsidising the poor of the country thats how its always going to be in every country  but our country has a lot of poverty this is going to get better  but not overnight its going to take time democracy is mob rule with less violence apart from a few oil rich countries  high income tax for rich people is the norm not the exception so if you think you are a high net worth individual then youre a free to go to any country in the world but be aware you will pay the same percentage or even more in tax#x200b the other point that the tax payers money is being wasted is a valid one  the individuals and companies who pay taxes  the 1  have absolutely no say in policies because the government wants to use the money to appease the other  99 lmao well making money becomes progressively easier the more money you have so a progressively higher tax slab isnt wrongwhether our tax money is put to good use is a different question and ofcourse if you have the luxury to move to a different country  you totally should  deleted   only 6 361 individuals declared incomes of over rs 5 crore   you are in the 1 of 1 of 1  arent you?  good for you #x200b  though the maximum marginal rate of 4274 tax appears high  it is comparable to the highest tax rates in some other countries in germany  the uk  japan and china  45 tax rate applies to incomes much below rs 5 crore annually  taking the current rupeedollar exchange rate  for example  45 rate applies to income of rs 204 crore in germany and rs 253 crore in japan in the us  for single tax filers  the top tax rate is 37 for income over rs 342 crore   source  economictimesindiatimesco  https  economictimesindiatimescom articleshow 70099837cms?utm_sourcecontentofinterestutm_mediumtextutm_campaigncppst   suggestion look into hiring a good accountant i dont think that even jeff bezos paid that much as his personal income tax sorry i cant hear the voice of the 12 people in india who actually declare income above 5 cr above the 99 who earn far more than that but show their income as 24 lpa yes  there is no incentive for superrich who declare taxes to live in india unfortunately it wont make a difference to the economy if the rich people leave  as 90 of the economy is unregulated  cashbased and built on black money i dont think the government was actually planning on collecting more taxes through this announcement  it will just incentivize the folks who are stuck here and cant leave  to hide their income this announcement was made just to please the gullible middle class and lower strata into thinking the government is being tough on the kaminey rich folks for a suitable bribe  most rich folks can get away with not paying the 42 tax i live in germany and pay 39 tax im not super rich anywhere  or even rich for that matter so apart from how the money is being used  i really dont see what you are complaining about,2019-07-24 20:57:33

Policy/Economy,indian economy,45,di4hk5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/di4hk5/indian_economy/,31,indias economy is going down which is a serious concern for all of uswhere are we doing wrong? what kind of policies do we need to make things better? in which sectors we should focus on more than the other? how can we make our voices heard to the government?please refrain from making this thread a political one,iams3n, economy is politicalha joon chang says this in his book  economics  a users guidein the old days  no country had a ministry of defence they all had a ministry of war because  well  war is what it really does patents used to be called patent monopolies  as they were  and still are  artificially created monopolies  even though they may be socially useful so there you have it sometimes  an old  forgotten name conveys the essence of the thing it is describing much better than the modern one does#x200b the same goes for the old name of economics  political economy  or the study of political management of the economy #x200b it is not possible to draw a clear boundary between economics and politics this is because the very boundary of the market is in the end determined by politics and not by an economic theory  of whatever variety#x200b before we even begin market transactions  we need  explicit and implicit  rules on what can be traded  who can trade them and how they can be traded in the market all of these rules are restrictive in some ways  and therefore no market is genuinely free and these ground rules cannot be determined by economic logic there is no scientific list of what should  or shouldnt  be bought and sold in the market the decision is a political one#x200b all societies keep certain things off the market  human beings  slavery   human organs  child labour  firearms  public offices  health care  qualifications to practise medicine  human blood  educational certificates and so on but there is no economic reason why any of these should not be bought and sold in markets indeed  all of them are or were legal objects of market transactions in different times and placesi dont know what policies we should make i would listen to people who have something to say about it instead of calling them antinational just because they are calling a spade a spade you asked not to make it political but the law makers and decision takers need to be economically educated people in the first place i dont care which color they prefer  they should have at least a masters or a compensable past record on the sector they are focusing on sorry  but how can we make this thread a non political one ?if the government in power doesnt have a clue or is not ready to frame new policies how can we revive our economy? centralisation of power is bad for economic growth the local governments should be given more freedom to form their own policies for economic development it is a must especially for a big country like indiaa small city in india or a district cant do much to improve its local gdp the city council or the zilla parishad dont have the sufficient funds or freedom to do ithowever  an us city can attract investors by giving them special tax breaks or cheap electricity it is the same in china the cities of china compete with each other to attract investment they also have sufficient funds to develop and maintain their infrastructure without waiting for the help of the state or federal government see  when uve got an  fm sharing ola  uber   whatts app  based forwards  or a minister of law and justice bringing out movie collections to show that the economy is blooming or when uve got the pm making constant claims of turning india into a 5 trillion economy at 5 gdp  theres little to no hope get in educated economists  wholl chart an actual roadmap if not   this is a sinking ship and were all ferrying on it  the recession is not purely cyclical  its systemic its kind of an indian made calamity we knew it was coming  just not that it would hit so soon demo  and then gst aagravated it and it hit us way harder the failure of majorscale capitalism in certain sectors was expected the failure of our socialist undertakings was also expected people have been talking about it for years however  since its expected  its was manageable and avoidablebut thats where we failed  since we elected the current government which led to the major economic mismanagement which is going onthose who say that only the current government caused it  are not completely right this economic calamity we see was a natural thing coming  but some decisions made without long term analysis brought it way too soon this is where we got fucked economic cycles happen  structural problems happen  and people are paid massive amounts of money to keep track of itin short we knew it was coming  we didnt know well manage it so badly and yeah  you can blame the government in my opinion the government should take a 3 step approach to tackle sluggish demand and slowdownstep1disinvest air india  mtnl  bsnl to start with  this will reduce the fiscal deficit burdenbring oil under gst ambit  not easy  congress perished taking consent on this from the states1 gst rate preferably between 5 to 10  and simpler filing norms for all items  the confusion and the frequent changes has caused massive uncertainty amongst small and medium scale traders and businesses  the mrp on all items should be inclusive of taxstep21 do not bail out firms like dhfl  ilfs etc  let them bleed  it would cause trauma for 2 to 3 quarters but the lending will be vigilent and risk mitigating measures would be taken once the firms are aware that they are on their own and the government wont be bailing out on them and repercussions might include jailtime2 reduce taxation from 30+cess to 20+cess for anyone under 50 lac salary  this is the population which really go out and spend since they aspire to be rich  wear branded clothes  phones  buy automobile  buy houses this would also lead to more tax filings and can lead to increase in tax collection3   focus on agrarian distress and start redistributing the money received from disinvestment and gst collection without putting burden on the fiscal targetsstep31 focus on education  cut defense spending and increase spending on primary and high school education  increase teacher salaries so that it becomes lucrative for people to take it up as a serious profession and bring innovation in this sector2 bring government banks and cooperative banks under the rbi scrutiny and not state and union governments which are prone to corruption and money laundering pre and post elections3 cut interest rates so that homeloans are in the range of 57 so that mortgage market and the biggest stable and secured source of income of banks is maintained4 reduce dependency on oil import  this is putting massive a dent in our gdp and also it would protect the environment but this is only possible once we have better rail gauges  high speed freight trains and loading and unloading costs and tariffs are marginalizedthere are many other measures government can adopt but given the shortterm 45 year goals  if i see atleast half the measures getting adopted  we will see a lot of poverty alleviated you asked not to make it political but the law makers and decision takers need to be economically educated people in the first place i dont care which color they prefer  they should have at least a masters or a commendable past record on the sector they are focusing on  where are we doing wrong?this recent interview with a former advisor to the govt pronab sen goes into some of this  here  https  wwwyoutubecom watch?vna2wdrrif3m   sen says that the government doesnt seem to have a game plan to fulfil the 5 trillion economy promise he explains what the government ought to do to revive the economy by prioritising growth and employment generation in the rural sector sen also assess two flagship schemes of the modi government  mudra yojna and  pm kisan yojna in this interview imo  one thing we are definitely doing wrong is not defining we properly id prefer a we that treats each citizen of india as an individual with potential  and then come up with ways to selfhelp as well as help one another rise into better economic situations this could be through local entrepreneurship ideas and partnerships  meetups  training camps  volunteering  skill sharing  side jobs  investments  even emigration rather than be stuck in a salaried job totally at the mercy of company and government finances  its better to have a weak centre with 29 states each of which is a standalone liberal economic powerhouse like norway or sweden the scope of we should be maxed out at state level  and then scaled down to district  city  town  area and individual levels with different policies at each leveland not a we where somehow the central government and its partys economic goals are treated as a proxy for each individuals economic wellbeing where its treated as a given that if central government reaches their 5t goal  it implies all 13b individuals have 38k income i have always viewed all our governments and their employees as being adversarial and smallminded  redtape  bribery  influencepeddling  threats  etc  rather than supportive  and this particular govt is more so than normal theres no point in ideating policies for central governments benefit  let them solve their own shit  please refrain from making this thread a political oneis it even possible? the economy is linked to politics it always is filling all institutes with yessir men they dont have the guts to confront the govt and ask them to take the correct steps manufacturing industrial output and wagesthis is what i would focus on but im not in the government  so it would be better if the government devises alongtermstrategyrather than appeasing the corporates with the regular tax cuts hoping the investments to happen india being an agrarian country investments in agricultural sector needsto bemade the top most priority and  calculated and systematic investments in infrastructure and manufacturing sectorshould done to generate jobs i think we are in for some  hard times reasons have been given by top economists  which our govt refuses to acknowledge publicly  how will it pan out  i dont knowhaving said that some sectors like white goods are upbeat and adding capacity  when auto and others are retrenching heavilyyou have to put more money in hands of people to boost consumption govt has to figure out how not an easy job and i think fm nirmala sitharaman is realizing  that now and most of her colleagues are speaking bullshiton a personal level  slash your expenses

Policy/Economy,real talk indias economic future is screwed and no one can do anything about it,22,e5d76w,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e5d76w/real_talk_indias_economic_future_is_screwed_and/,8,im starting this based on an assumption that the only way for lowermiddle income countries like india to prosper is through a manufacturingled  exportoriented economythis is the only proven model of prosperity in the 20th and 21st centuriesthis manufacturing cant be just any kind it has to be low skill  highvolume in order to employ a large number of people indias current manufacturing pattern is mostly filled with highskill  low employment products like jewellery  medicine  cars  and softwareits far easier to train 10 000 people to make iphone accessories than it is to get them to make carsbut this kind of highvolume  low skill manufacturing isnt coming to india  regardless of any policy push from the government a few reasons why#x200b 1 competitors in se asia a  have specialized in certain products  like garments in bangladesh   b  have fewer roadblocks to investment from the populace  they are autocracies or pseudodemocracies   and c  have a cultural affinity with china  such as vietnam  which makes it easier for chinese manufacturers to move shop there2 businesses are built on relationships  not just policy leverage policy makers dont get this because very few of them have ever run businesses by now  american businesses have had decadelong relationships with their chinese manufacturers these chinese manufacturers are now building factories in vietnam  laos and cambodia if you were an american business  who would you rather partner with  an unknown entity in india  or the vietnamese arm of the chinese manufacturer you know and trust?3 supply chains are hard to build and harder to optimize if you wanted to be a manufacturing power in 2020  you would have had to start work for it in 2015  not 2019 weve lost that moment4 indias regional inequality means that the states with cheap labor  bihar  up  are also the states where no one wants to invest in because of law and order problems5 indias democracy means that everything becomes much more challenging for a manufacturer  land acquisition  labor issues  etc vietnam  meanwhile  can bulldoze whatever the hell it wants to bulldoze and put up a red carpet for manufacturers6 and this might be a biased personal take  but ive felt that indian manufacturers dont have business competence ive tried to build products in india as well as china our chinese partners treated us as a small company that might later be a big company  and gave us that respect and priority our indian partner treated us as a small fry and was more keen on getting shortterm profit than build a longterm relationshipi feel that the moment where india could be a manufacturing power is past us without manufacturing  youll have a situation where#x200b 1 the state has to spend more and more on welfare to tackle unemployment among a young population2 to pay for this welfare  the state will increasingly overreach in tax collection youre seeing this already where a small section of the population pays nearly all the taxes3 the small portion of people who have good jobs will be increasingly resentful of their taxes being spent on welfare this  coupled with environmental issues  will accelerate brain drain and capital flight4 without the capital and manpower  employment generation will be even slower  forcing the state to squeeze even more if the welfare dole stops  it knows there is going to be widespread unrest 5 all this welfare will tax the state exchequer more and more were seeing this already  the government has hit its fiscal deficit target for the year in just 7 months 6 one the welfare dole stops  tens of millions of unemployed  angry  poor people will only do what they can do revolt#x200b or is there a silver lining to this cloud?,mrfreeze2000, all popular grievances and administrative obstacles neatly outlined financial planners have been giving the government the call for course correction but the government is tone deaf to the problems of the common man as long as dalal street is happy silver lining a lot of these points you mentioned are low hanging fruit for indian policymakers and industry for instance  the attitude problem of indian companies could change with experience  exposure and opportunities manufacturing country ship has sailed long ago the future will be driven by ai and manufacturing will be replaced by robotstake a look at any advance car manufacturer lot of work is being designated to robots and almost a skeleton crew of engineer exist to ensure products are checked to ensure they meet the standard also  know as qc quality and control joblike data entry will also be largely replaced it will exist for a long time cause they basically ride the code for a lot of these future techs we will have a lot of jobless people who need to be reskilled to meet the demands of the future we are an agriculture heavy industry another thing we boast is cheap healthcare the future lies in these two sectors develop these and you are good to go for the next 30 years or so i work in the biotech field its a highly niched field where very few products make it to the market after years of rd but biotech as such has a lot of overlap with this healthcare and agriculture lets give india 4 years by then if the

Policy/Economy,my views on the current right wing inclined folks today,71,d7ormq,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d7ormq/my_views_on_the_current_right_wing_inclined_folks/,40,i wont deny that i have never really inclined towards the right tor the left but there are certain things that i like more about each side for example  the left believing in the rights of the lgbt community but well  when congress was in power  i was more on the conservative side because congress really felt like a  pappu government in my opinion im from hyderabad  so  i never had to vote for congress or the bjp and im happy about not having to choose one of them congress had some questionable policies but the situation the bjp has led our country into  i mean its outrageous ive never seen modi  commenting on the unnao rape victim ive never  seen him assure the country about the current economic situation he simply doesnt seem to care poor tulsi  lost some of her followers for meeting modi such is the impression that our beloved pm has on the international stage i dont know  i dont see these modi praisers talking about the economy at all i am a little inclined to the right more than the left but this is just shameful that this guy called modi has led us into this pit ive never seen him addressing the nation on the issues at ground level all he does is spew out patriotic and emotional bullshit i am patriotic and all but it alarms me that our pm has no say in the mob lynchings im from hyderabad  i live in a population dominated by hindu and muslimcommunitys there have been minor clashes here and there but there were no riots and no bad blood between the two communities hell  i have so many muslim friends  but growing up with them ive never felt the difference between my hindu and muslim friends you see  with all these lynchings and forcing of jai shree ram slogans has affected one way or the other before all this crap  we used to break each others balls  make fun of the religions and never got anyone offended suddenly  i look around now and we are still the same mates we were  but we think twice before bringing up a religious joke thats whatthe modi government has given us everybody has the internet  everyone knows whats happening  this has to be addressed our countrys economy  our secularism  our linguistic freedom  have all gone down the drain and when these right wing people talk about modi as if he descended from the whitest clouds  it makes my skin crawl,Travis_Bickle96, unrelated advice please use line breaks in your future posts gave up reading your post in a moving car im from hyderabad and i totally agree im on mobile and reading your post seems like youre slightly left aligned indian political line is completely imbalanced you are calling yourself more inclined to the right and you may be correct in that but from indian perspective you are a liberal and left  wing or libratd from a rw perspective even in this sub where people represent themselves as leftwing doesnt support communism or they are more near to center of political spectrum  you can say that india political spectrum is dominated by right wing extremists with no left wing extremists to balance them and extremism is always bad i usually refrain for commenting on politics here apart from a few sly remarks here and thereno one in the indian polity cares about the middle class general category students and job seekersthats how i feel about it at 22a conclusion drawn on the basis of my observation and analysisthe reason i dont indulge excessively in the clusterfuck of political discussions is due to this thought that  no political party when  in power would care a fig about us reiterating ki aadat  the cult of personality is a huge problem i wasnt around during the indira gandhi era so i have no idea what that was like but ive never seen anything like this before the supreme leader meme is real life now being a moderate hindu conservative  i have to agree india has become extremely dangerous for people who arent hindu heck  i a saw a reporter writing about how bjp is not doing enough for hindus if you think this is bad  wait for the future the bjp will go all out to create a surveillance state  in which all dissent will be crushed they are already pushing for facebook and other tech giants to break their encryption the case is in the sc  but when was the last time the sc delivered a verdict against the government? their will be elections  and perhaps they would be fair too  but because of the constant propaganda spread by the media and the government  they will win a majority everytime democracy doesnt die in one night you dont suddenly wake up in the morning  with the constitution gone it happens bit by bit  piece by piece everyday you lose a part of your freedom  oh they banned reddit  porn  wikipedia? no worries  ill just use a vpn but there will be a day  where there will be no vpns  no computers  no internet  and no life as we know it today there will only be leaders  and people who kneel before them somebody copy paste without those line gaps please  before all this crap  we used to break each others balls  make fun of the religions and never got anyone offendedsame here earlier it was a joke  and it was understood among my circle that there were no malicious intentions now it all became real  or rather it was not real atleast among my circle  young teens  20s men  the same joke you used to make for fun  now you see a bjp retard saying it  whipping up a crowd to violence  etc dude format your post properly bruh edit this  poor tulsi  lost some of her followers for meeting modithat was perhaps expected as the far left hates both modi and trump with a passion i just followed her on twitter  hopefully more will do so and itll balance out the most annoying part imo is that theres no real sensible opposition party congress is a stale shitshow and other regional parties cant do anything and dont even get me started on the communists pm has no say in the mob lynchings im from hyderabad  i live in a population dominated by hindu and muslim communitys there have been minor clashes here and there but there were no riots and no bad blood between the two communitiesso  if you hate right wingers so much why would you elect politicians like owaisi repeatedly? i guess you guys are too young to remember the glory days of the 90s when india was literally burning with caste politics  terrorism in punjab  in kashmir and delhi especially was flooded with pandits who were refugees in your own countryi was a little girl then  but i cannot imagine now what political instability and intense divisions that existed in society then these are the facts  none of modi governments schemes have favoured one community at the disadvantage of the other  the only exception to the above is triple talaaq bill  which is scdriven  but there is no way this was being brought in by congress  google shah bano case to see how muslim women in india were set back into the stone age by socalled democratic secular forces  this was to the advantage of muslims in general  because what benefits women of a community  whole community benefit even demonetisation was preceded by drive to open bank accounts of the poorest  there has been electrification of villages at a faster rate than the preceding congress govt there have been subsidies on gas that have directly benefitted the poorest women you probably dont know jack about cooking  so may not understand my favourite part is the speech on 15th august 2015 re toilets  from the red fort i have been a fan of modi since then because i see a genuine drive to address basic needs of the people by this governmenti dont know why i am responding to your vitriol to be honest  but india has just concluded the largest election ever and handed an even bigger victory to modi if secularism and freedom etc were going down the drain  then you wouldnt be airing your opinion on this sub the opposition leader literally called the pm a murderer liar you know what happened? like any fascist dictatorship  he was challenged in the court  and lost that surely is depth of fascism isnt it? you know whom i supported in delhi? kejriwal  because of the way nirbhaya case was put in the limelight what has he done for womens safety in delhi? jack dont tell me free metro rides  because thats an election jumla which is not going to give any benefits if it was then it wouldnt have been announced 4 years 9 months into his termwhats more important than speaking from a podium about an issue is doing something about it the unnao rape accused has been arrested but please contribute to this echo chamber more,2019-09-23 00:08:25

have we been taught capitalism incorrectly? the numbers are so clear yet we are still stuck in denial about having government involvement in the economy so many people flock to capitalist economies from india yet why do we trust the government so much?and before anyone says  yes i do think healthcare  defense  law and order should be under government along with economic incentives for education and research but beyond that  you dont really need government,ohdickens, i remember  in the early 90s  my cousin brother endeavored to start a toy manufacturing company it took a year and half to get all the permissions regarding land usage and taxeswhen he finally got to the stage of producing toys  he was already in losses as the interest for the loan kept pilling up  he had taken loans for machinery  which lay idle for a year  as he could not get permissions for manufacturing  when he finally started  he had to price the toys higher to offset some of the increasing debt but then  if you remember  extremely cheap chinese toys flooded the market  postliberalization  and he had to declare bankruptcy after 4 years and close the companyall because of red tapismthis relates to point 5 of yours i believe it has to do more with the indian capitalists rather than to do with capitalism as such indian capitalists such as nirav modi and ramalinga raju who had successful business empire yet resorted to illegal activities sure there are illegal activities everywhere such as enron scandal but indian businesses are too profit oriented  they treat their customers like shit before the entry of mnc in india  many indian businesses had no policy of return even if the goods were damaged  they would instead blame the customer and government made slogans such as buyers beware i still remember in early 90s how one of the big conservative textile shop in my city had a no return policy  they refused to take back damaged good they had sold us  i went to the same shop this year  they had a 15 days return policy what a surprise mncs changed all this but still people had a sour experience in general with these indian capitalists add to the fact the mncs remind them about east india company from our history text books when the indian businesses change their shitty outlook  indians would start trusting them wtfyou cited ambani and adani as having no competition are you real?lets take the  telecoms sector and new entrant jio jio came in and destroyed all the competition by lowering price that made most telecom companies either merge or go bust a good telecom regulator would have in some way prevented predatory pricing allowing fair competition to all players in this sector every news be like  government is god i think the second point relates to affordability do people have choice with the amount of money they have or how many people with that kind of money do we have? the problem is not that we are taught capitalism incorrectly  the problem is that we are not taught capitalism at all we have been having bad leaders for a really long time now political parties have been playing with the emotions of the poor by spreading lies about the wealthy they also know that it is easier to win an election by giving freebies and loan waivers than actually giving a damn about long term policies the distrust is because of bad leaders hiding their incompetency behind lies indian society is a low trust society as it is i dont know the historical and sociological processes that have turned it this way  but it is what it is its made worse at the street level by the neighbourhood shopkeeper who isnt exactly a model of honesty anywhere in india even bigger businesses arent exactly ethical with their customers  are they? probably  the deep distrust of businesses stems from these two factors its not entirely unwarranted a poor justice system and the role of influence in law enforcement means its better to start with distrust and be overcautious  rather than trust and lose money#x200b at a government level  nehru had the biggest influence in how governments look at businesses as somebody who had seen the bad effects of colonial capitalist greed on our society  he was instinctively anticapitalist that attitude grew worse with indira when highest levels of taxation on businessmen were imposed in the 70s and 80s naturally  they preferred to launder it to tax havens  and i think it is this image of taxevading businesses that has been imprinted in the modern indian bureaucrats and citizens mind omg dude  what have you done you talked aboutcapitalismhere? oh god  prepare to be bashed and the downvoteswell jokes aside  the recent emergence of socialists in america and india are reactionary humans are shitheads and when they came to know this  since they cant blame humans  they are taking their anger out on the system  capitalism nice scapegoat you have a problem with your relations?

Policy/Economy,economic shit storm incoming brace for impact  what failure of corporate tax rate may imply,70,d76uvt,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d76uvt/economic_shit_storm_incoming_brace_for_impact/,16,before getting bombarded  let me say that it is what if scenario which is rather pessimistic but a possibility nonetheless  and i vehemently believe that we are facing growth recession if not outright recession as of now 1  lack of new job creation  decrease in purchasing power  negligible increase in either headline inflation or core inflation  23 gdp growth rate  if we calculate gdp using previous base year  has substantiated that we are or are heading to recession recession doesnt always mean negative gdp growth rate 2  uncertain and draconian policy  fast changing policies which have proved to be bereft of commitment by actual spending and pervading religious divide and ideology is eating away a part of budgetdamocles sword3  infrastructure projects underway  but for whome? bullet train  statues and home creation  but none of them are infrastructure investment which will help economy at scale and will come out to bite few years later4  migrating tendency  large mobilisation by semielite and educated group due to ease of getting residential cards given that you are competent it should increase by substantial amount after global economy slow down is over and again will bite back later due to the fact that with lack of skilled man power fewer companies will investdeflation  lack of buffer and misguided policies5  corporation tax cut  current situation is because of lack of purchasing power even among those who are employed and even a cursory glance at past will tell that india has never seen tickle down impact so i dont expect increase in pp 1  it will fail to attract new investment 2  goods may get cheaper which will lead to deflation6  possible deflation  with lack of buffer and policy failure  we will spiral down to deflation and products will get cheaper but people will start losing jobs at hitherto ratenew minted currency as catalyst to breaking economic cycle and perhaps for even worse 7  bottleneck inflation leading to stagflation  demand will stay the same or may even increase while infrastructure will be severely lacking and to boost economy  we may see new minted currencies and it will lead to rising prices inflation  but job loss will still stay the same 8  lack of foreign investment  above should be enough to deter any large fdi flow global currency inr will get devalued significantly to attract investment and will further push outward mobilisation,lightnh,  deleted  things certainly look shitty but it may be too early to call it a doomsday kind of scenario  govt fucked up and have realized their mistakes  they are too egoistic to admit their mistakes but have reverted back some of their shitty moves  the corporate tax cut is not going to fix demand issues directly or right away but can help attract some of the investments moving out of china that can be a huge plus in the years to comebullet train looks like a white elephant currently but if you think  wouldnt be great to have world class trains here like other developed countries?  and not just for ornamental reasons or for the politics of it  imagine the growth of business if bangalore  chennai or other similar places  the travel can be done within 2 hours?  infrastructure investments otherwise is a good thing  the roadways  tunnels and waterways will help future generations  if anything we need to have even more infra development projects  dont we love the infra of foreign countries?  these projects dont happen over night and need hige amount of planning and vision infra projects also provide employment to thousands of people  which helps with gdp and helping with demand side issuesmigration has always been a thing there is nothing new about it all the people participating in howdy modi are people who migrated out of the country looking for better prospects isnt it?  it may be another topic all together that they assume it to be their moral and birth right to comment on what is good or bad for india we are country of 13 billion people  few crores people migrating will not necessarily hurt us if at all it can help bring in remittance  yes  brain drain is a thing it has been around for generations and i dont see it reducing anytime soon  perhaps spreading of rightwingers govt everywhere in the world may mitigate it a bit due to racism etcyes  there are draconian policies and misadventures like demon  shitty gst implementation  ugly and useless statues etc but good economics does not necessarily mean good politics  and to win elections  one needs good politics and optics  the wrath of the market forced govt to rollback some of their shitty policies  the euphoria behind corp tax cut may not last forever  and pure economics may start playing  and as i started off  it may be too early to call it a may day good points work on your exit plansome tips here https  wwwredditcom r india comments 81r29c your_onestop_guide_to_emigrating_long_term_to  what do you want  all kind of tax to be 2 wait for it  they will do something your picking up already known and discussed points and trying to be famous stop it  wait some time and let it happenthey did slash tax rates  they increased cafiene beverages tax rate  banned e cigs to boost itc revenue and stocks  your either blind  no offence  or late into the discussion or to impatient to wait a few months morebut the points are good to start with you know your evaluations well aswell but all things you mention are subjective no objective data provided so yeah whatever,2019-09-21 19:35:07

whats missing? hey you could open your channel and let the viewers donate many people are doing this independent journalism like faye d souza who just opened her channel after being fired or she just quit?  look for these channels as well kumar shyam  aam press tv get you own channel try newslaundry im no expert  but maybe try writing your own articles  opinion pieces etc and use free platforms like youtube n such or offer them to local newspapers and magazines once youve got sufficient by lines you could apply to bigger publications there is a great dearth of good  well researched and independent journalists in india most of them now are pushing some agenda or ideology print journalism may still have some integrity but electronic media is a cesspool before even switching on the television  most of us can predict the spin each channel will put on a certain event journalists are much needed for this country the battlefield of the 21nd century is going to be information and attention with you people being the force multipliers of the arena though you are struggling now and have stumbled  dont falter  good luck op find your niche and everything shall follow do not feel disappointed try getting in touch newslaundry? apna business khol do didi digital content marketing aur baaki sab write your own article and slowly build up your website best of luck write a book anything thats stopping you from doing that? as in the beat that you cover is not popular etc? i agree with most of the opinions here if you arent in bad place financially  start your own channel blog  and publicise the hell out of it on fb reddit ig whatever it doesnt require a lot of initial investment  financially atleast   and youd also be adding worthwhile experience to your portfolio  further making you an attractive candidate later down the lineif you need any help setting up something  you only need ask you have it in you already  you just need to go ahead and give it your best shotyou can do it op  we all believe in you   happens do introspection figure out what is missing work on small small things  guess  i am just tired of getting rejectedno one has the authority or power to reject you you allow others to do so so  there is no point in getting tired or feel bad rather  i see such rejections as a difference of opinion  thats itjournalism  in the age of digital  is one of the most exciting things to do keep expressing your views  via words  videos  images  and choose a platform to do so facebook  twitter  youtube are the current hot favourites  and if you are consistent  the right eyes will see you  the right ears will hear you 7 years of experience doesnt matter in this dynamic industry your voice  your persistence  and your unique angle of viewing things doesall the best have you tried zee news?

Sports,tablighi jamaat  covid,21,ftltyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ftltyk/tablighi_jamaat_covid/,7,it was extremely irresponsible for the members of the tablighi jamaat to have gathered in light of the covid pandemic an fir has been filed against the maulana  others and hopefully the police will carry out a thorough investigation and the court will determine whether theyve violated any of the laws applicable and punish them accordingly  lets look at certain facts pertaining to the situation  1 firstly  this was a 3day religious gathering  between  march 1315  https  twittercom atishiaap status 1244892528945565696   and this was much before the lockdown in delhi  from march 23   the nationwide lockdown  from march 25 2 the delhi government has alleged that the tablighi jamaats 3 day religious congregation amounts to a violation of their  order dated 13032020  https  twittercom atishiaap status 1244892528945565696   which prohibits all sports gathering  including ipl   conferences  seminars beyond 200 people     note that this order was issued on march 13  the very same day that the event had already    begun  implying that the attendees were already in delhi by the time the delhi govt issued the order      courts will have to determine whether the wording of the order all sports gathering  conferences  seminars beyond 200 people will cover this 3day religious congregation     the fir  https  twittercom delhipolice status 1244983752314564608  filed also alleges criminal conspiracy  which will also have to be investigated and proved before the court 3 so essentially  the legal process has been initiated against them and if they did violate any of the existing orders or law in question  they will be punished  in this light  holding a media trial is uncalled for we dont even have all the facts in the public domain   for instance  the  delhi govt itself blames the police  https  twittercom atishiaap status 1244892528945565696  for not having enforced its march 13 order  given that the nizamuddin police station is right next to the place where the religious congregation took place4 further  a quick look at the general mood of the country as on march 13  points to the fact that concepts such as social distancing  selfquarantining werent popularised by the governments to the extent that we see today   for instance  as on march 13  the number of cases we had was 81  as opposed to the 2000 cases today  and addressing reporters  health ministry joint secretary had said on march 13 itself  that  coronavirus is not a health emergency  there is no need to panic  https  theprintin health coronaviruscasesriseto81inindiagovtsayscovid19notahealthemergency 380819   5 a number of events took place between march 13 and march 22   janata curfew   followed by the lockdown  involving huge numbers of people  religious places of worship with thousands of devotees  political events including toppling a certain state government  etc  while legal action has to be taken against people flouting the law  be it hindus  muslims  whoever  holding a media trial and bashing the entire muslim community  trending coronajihad  does no one any good in fact  it alienates the muslim community even more  spreading more hate against muslims at large is irresponsible  criminal in itself,CuteFaithlessness6,  while legal action has to be taken against people flouting the law  be it hindus  muslims  whoever  holding a media trial and bashing the entire muslim community  trending coronajihad  does no one any good in fact  it alienates the muslim community even more  spreading more hate against muslims at large is irresponsible  criminal in itselfits too late dude many people in my community now believe that muslims are deliberately spreading covid19 even my parents think that muslims have shown their true colors these 2000 idiots have increased hatred for rest of the muslim community wasnt there a bigger gathering else where in india that happened a day later? this whole thing reeks of islamaphobia  the media trial  however if they did break the law the due punishments should be vetted out but only equally and fairly my gut tells me it wont,2020-04-03 02:24:47

investing thousands of hours practicing? do you think the society will accept it? they ll just brand the guy addicted to gaming  gaming is bad  it should be banned crosspost to r indiangaming as well we need a break out star in a competitive game like faker or sumail  so we can kick start more poeple in our country we have teams but they are just so far behind international standards but hopeful since we have so many tournaments now than compared to last decade in my local area  a lot of gaming pubs host dota and csgo tournamentsbut i believe its gonna be a long while before esports becomes recognised over here unless people take gaming seriously nothings gonna happen half of my friends didnt knew pubg was a thing unless it hit the play store i feel pathetic for people calling themselves gamers who play on mobile and despise pc gaming   my friends tease me for playing games on pc saying i have no life and shit and yet they play pubg the whole day  esports wont be a thing unless someone is ready to take flak head on from the indian society our aunties and unkills who believe in doctor and engineer species only i hope someone revives itin the few years ive seen some really great indian born games on mobile gaming platform theyre not 10 10 but at least theyre of the same quality we deserve compared to the western counterpartrecently our college was creating clubs i wanted to make an esports club badly but i realized 90 of my colleagues wouldnt know its meaning the idea got buried even if i did manage to get the courage and tell my faculties i want an esports club and explain them  i m pretty sure theyd laugh their ass off and forget about it next day the general rat culture in our country does not provide a conducive environment for competitive games like dota csgo to flourishwe might have more players than europe but the skill level is terrible i dont thing pubg mobile is going anywhere when it comes to esports its not precise enough cause touch screen for an event involving skill give it another 10 years and it will become an olympic sport first of all  let  redeye talk some sense into you its esports  https  wwwyoutubecom watch?vbo8iav_daoy  im a fellow competitive csgo follower  rip astralis era btw  majority of india has no concept of esports i think we need to convince a certain influential gujarati man to educate our masses about esports  because i see no other way of esports growth in india not in the near future at least people dont considered gaming streaming an occupation here i bet most of the people dont know about joining esport orgs for e sports to be a thing people must buy the damn gamesexcluding cheap and free games like cs dota tf2 etc which game has a large enough player base to even ask this question? pc parts cost 2x more in india and people dont think its good investment the reason why esports havent taken off in india is that we dont have any fallback options there are no social safety net and any breaks taken during education is extremely frowned upon by indian society and in extent indian firms lets say  you try your hands on esports  you play well but not good enough to make a living out of it then you need to get a job and thats only backed up by education no firm will hire you if you put esports in your cv not to mention if you take a break in your studies to pursue esports  theres a good chance your cv will be thrown into the dustbin even before it reaches the interviewerthe same is applicable for other type of sports football is very popular in west bengal  but most players are struggling hard to make ends meet if youve watched dangal then youd know what happens to amir in the movie is a reflection of what happens to our society in general the only two ways to make an honest living in india is either through education or through business esports wont help you in either in the long run dont you remember the pm referencing pubg?

journal emerging microbes and infections has cautioned that sarscov2  the virus causing the covid19 outbreak  is being shed through multiple routes  so testing through oral swabs alone might not be sufficient a paper by wei zhang  et al  all from the cas key laboratory of special pathogens at the wuhan institute of virology  says investigations on patients in a local hospital infected with the virus revealed the presence of sarscov2 in anal swabs and blood as well whats more  more anal swabs than oral swabs tested positive at a later stage of infection since covid19 is believed to be a disease of the respiratory tract  usually only oral swabs are used for diagnosis  and discharge is based on the oral swabs testing negative the anal positives suggested  they argued  shedding through the oral fecal route  and therefore transmission is possible as well the researchers also showed that a serology test  testing blood for antibodies  can improve detection positive rate  and thus should be used in the future as part of the research  samples  including oral swabs  anal swabs and blood were collected by wuhan pulmonary hospital two investigations were performed the paper describes  in the first investigation  samples were taken from 39 patients  7 of whom were in a severe condition in the second investigation  samples were lifted from 139 patients  whose clinical records were not available when counting all swab positives together  we found most of the positives came from oral swab  8 10  80  on day 0 however  this trend appears to change on day 5 we found more  6 8  75  anal swab positive than oral swab positive  4 8  50  the data suggested a shift from more oral positives during the early period to more anal positives during the later period the current strategy for the detection of viral rna in oral swabs used for 2019ncov diagnosis is not perfect the virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative this observation implies that a patient cannot be discharged purely based on oral swabs testing negative  and the researchers go on to make a recommendation to do serological tests to confirm the status#### about coronavirusescoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that may cause illness in animals or humans in humans  several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging

is your goal worth those sacrifice? you have a lot of soul searching to do here if you let your parents control the very aspect of your life that you have to live with all your life then you will resent the hell out of them when you have a failure in your academic life or eventual career  which  believe you me  everyone does ill give you two examples here  both are of my friends and you can take from it whatever you like my friend named ashish comes from a marwari family and his father is a sales consultant when he was 17  he was adamant that he wanted to do hospitality management like his cousin  who was pursuing it in london and not become a ca like his father wanted him to be he eventually gave into his fathers wishes and pursued being a ca it took him 7 years to become a ca but he eventually became one and now has his own practice he earns decent money now  married but resents his father to this daythe second guy  nikunj  brilliant in studies  just like you  and wanted to pursue commerce to become a banker but his parents insisted he do engineering since he scored to high a percentage in his boards to waste it by doing a commerce course he never completed his engineering and resented his parents for it he eventually got into actuarial science and flourished  eventually his relationship with his parents improved too take what you may of these examples but imho you do what you love to do in life money will follow you no matter what if you love what you do and are good at what you do the money will come to you no matter whatps  your parents expecting you to cook for your husband everyday is beyond shameful i hope you dont feel obligated to be the typical subservient woman that is expected in an indian household after your marriage  if you choose to marry this patriarchal shit needs to end  deleted   deleted  two questions  how far are you willing to go? and how far will your parents go? the choice you are going to make is a difficult one whatever choice you make  it is going to define your near future  or maybe even far   for better or for worse talk to your parents about this it is not only just what you say  but also how you say it matters they shouldnt think that you making a decision based on a fantasy or something  dont be afraid to tell your parents what you feel about them  add on extra resentment to your feelings if you feel like itid like to assume they are someone who loves their daughter more than log kya kahenge bullshit at least  it was the case for me and my sister the ultimatum to choose between their son and not talking to them for over 2 months plus not staying in home for more than whats required to sleep  brush  and shit sure showed them that i was serious with my threats indian society sure does teach their children to be a headless chicken in pursuit of their parents dreams if you think you need your parents  in the future  maybe consider for a second that you probably dont need them i am going to go out on a limb and drop an unpopular opinion  you are not obligated to love your parents you are not obligated to do shit for them but they  on the other hand  are obligated to look after you if they treat you like human  you treat them the same way just like any other person if they dont  you dont either i would 100 advice you to be as blunt as possible with your parents now tell them exactly how you feel not just about your career but also about your relation with them in the future  even if it sours your relationship with them now personally  it made the relationship between me and my mother a lot stronger than it was even if they went into the gutter a for a couple of years in between simple thingask yourself is this something that i would love doing all my life ??even if this doesnt work out youre in a better place than a whole lot of people whats wrong in being a chef ?

Food,american wondering how to tactfully refuse food,88,fw3ws1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fw3ws1/american_wondering_how_to_tactfully_refuse_food/,30,so i live in america and work in the home of a family from india i tutor their child since schools have cancelled for the year in my state they have increased my hours  meaning that i am around for lunchtime now  and they have absolutely insisted on feeding me this is very nice of them and all of the food they have made me is delicious  but they give me so much ill tell them that im full but then theyll bring me another portion  and i feel like i must eat it because it would be rude to refuse is there a way to tactfully tell them when ive had enough food? the last thing i want to do is disrespect their generosity,ouchmytongue, welcome to indian kitchens this is universal  and the only way out of this is to insist you are full when you have a lil bit of space left this way you can eat their final serving  and continue to flatten your curve as well  so to speakedit do bring in a dessert sometime return the favour indian families generally insist on serving more food until you insist you are full its a cultural thing in older days people were shy to ask more food being guests this was understood by the host the hosts  hence tend to feed them more assuming the guest is shy these days people are generally very forthcoming  especially in american culture i observe that people are honest and absolute with what they want and how much they want  but sometimes  being hosts  they err on the side of caution to ensure the guest is satisfied just insist that you are full politely and say  you have reached your capacity they will usually understandanother thing to do is  hold your palm facing the ground over the plate  to block the food and just insist more telling you are full this gesture is an accepted gesture in various gatheringsthank them for the food and appreciate the cooking so that they know you are satisfied hope this helps oh boyi have some good tips for you1  eat slow2  when you are done  quickly put the bits that have fallen through the edges back into the plateso the plate becomes unservable3  just get up and wash your hands when done no eye contact tried and tested in the fieldps all techniques tested on my wifes family where i face the same issue i am fasting today typical indian household lol its endearing in a way but tbh i always feel like i cant walk or that i am going to throw upjust insist that you are full and just ask small quantities of different varieties of food it wont be that bad once they are used to have you around during lunchtime and get familiar with your portion sizes just eat real slow  they will get it that you are having trouble finishing it tell them that you will ask if you want more  or that you will take the food by yourself when you want more  eg tell them you guys also eat  ill take how much ever i want  i dont want to trouble you   eat slow to match speed of others eating in the house or tell that if you eat a lot  you will end up feeling ill initially smile and after 23 times  tell politely but firmly with semiserious face many years ago  a fellow american friend i knew in dilli consumed an entire stick of butter out of politeness the cultural norm is that as a guest  if you actually do want to be served more food  you only refuse mildly guests will usually not directly say  yes  i do want more instead they will just not protest too strongly when the hosts are serving you more food so  when you actually do become full and definitely dont want more  you have to politely but very firmly say no you have to insist  like one of the other comments said dont worry  its not rude another tip is  eat slowly if you finish too fast  theyll think youre still hungry why do you think most indians have a potbelly and are generally unfit? i dont understand what it is with parents and relatives that they will always put more than you need in your plate and think that its healthy to eat more while its clearly not my diet always gets screwed because of my parents overfeeding me even if i refuse to eat more they just put more on the plate and i have to eat because i dont like wasting food i need to be more stern otherwise i have to spend more time with my dumbells to shed those extra carbs refusing food is not rude unless you do it rudely fast for a day id say its better to say youre full  since it works like a charm for me tbh its my family hence i dont get pushed too often it is typical of many families to insist one more portion to ensure even the meek leave with full tummy some hosts keep on feeding even if they might not have sufficient for themselves they also believe that the way youd refuse  once you have eaten to your liking  say that you liked it so much that you already are full to your hearts content and do not have room for more say you dont shy from food and if needed youll ask for more by yourself  say this in a jolly tone  also  as others have said  physically block them from serving another portion by holding your hand slightly above your plate or bowl thats an accepted way of saying you dont want more tell them you have an upset stomach thats what i do something i do  but only if people are very insistent i yank my plate off the table and protect it with my hand until the other person retreats#x200b this absolute last resort  but if your plate isnt there  they cant serve you you should say that you are following very strict diet plan relax its just culture you have to refuse lovingly  three or four times before theyll stop asking tell them you had something to eat already somewhere else say you have allergies keep passing comments like  today the food is a little oily salt is less in the food today i think the gravy stinks  was it yesterdays dish you recycled? roti couldve been softer  daal at the house next door at sharmas is tastierif they still offer you food quitedit clearly this is being taken as a serious comment i was in the mood to shit post my bad take but dont eat i know its not good to waste food but its perhaps the only way ensure that the food gets wasted by may be mixing curries with staple  half eating sweets etc when they ask you  say you are full and cant eat anymore they will still continue giving excessive food to you for a few days but then they will start paying heed to your words graduallye  it worked for me everywhere may be they namecall me behind my back but who cares?,2020-04-07 07:49:25

social distancing rules to those suggesting muslims are immune to coronavirus  the delhi police say they have uncovered a concerted misinformation campaign that poses a serious challenge to the governments efforts to contain the ongoing pandemic in an investigation of the content being shared on whatsapp and apps like tiktok in the first week of the nationwide lockdown  the delhi police said they have found many of the videos specifically targeting the muslim community by quoting religious text and leaders an analysis of more than 30 000 videos on the social networking over the last five days found that most of the fake information and posts are created in hindi and urdu for a specific audience  the police said the videos were analysed by the police with the help of security researchers  fact checkers and data analysts and a report on the digital investigation has been accessed by ndtv according to early estimates  more than 1 crore people have already seen these videos  suggesting a high degree of circulation and impact several of these videos appear to be shot in pakistan and middle east but audio in hindi has been superimposed to make it look like its shot in india  the 22page report  which the delhi police has shared with various intelligence agencies  says our analysis has revealed an alarming number of videos are being shared advising muslims not to practice social distancing and several suggesting that coronavirus does not kill muslims  a senior police official said according to him  the analysis also revealed a pattern in dissemination of misinformation while analysing the origins and sources of these videos  it was observed that several of the accounts which originally created them are being deleted regularly after the content goes viral to hide its origin  he said considering the fact that most of these videos have been created with professional video editing software  being viralled  sic  on social media platforms  original uploader accounts being deleted  and certain accounts peddling fake news among muslims are promoting pakistani religious leaders with terror links a further investigation into the likely role of foreign actors needs to be investigated  the report says according to the investigation  chineseowned video sharing app tiktok is the most preferred medium for creating and spreading videos with religious instigations against health advisories and fake information regarding the coronavirus these videos are further being shared on whatsapp  facebook and twitter videos of muslims refusing to get themselves tested and beating medical personnel were being spread and others were also being encouraged to do the same  the report says religious texts are being quoted to not stop shaking hands and people are being encouraged to go to their religious shrines even during lockdown  it adds authorities have expressed concern about the impact of these videos amid attacks on medical personnel like in madhya pradeshs indore this week and the emergence of a cluster in delhi because of a gathering held by a muslim missionary group last month that has spawned dozens of cases across the country in the investigation into the delhi congregation  the police are looking into a sermon allegedly by the chief cleric of the group tablighi jamaat that termed the directions of doctors as a conspiracy to keep muslims away from fellow muslims since then  maulana saad kandhalvi has officially issued an audio message to his followers asking them to cooperate with the government to fight the disease we have to take precautions  follow the guidance of the doctors and give full support to the government such as not crowding into places this is not against the principles of islam  he said while at around 2 000 cases and 53 deaths  the spread of coronavirus in india is far more limited than in europe and the us  health experts have warned that the numbers could surge across the country if the contagion takes

welltheyll find any germ or healthrelated excuse they can to fuck over muslims very important question these could be staged  doctored or old  or it could be new and true whats disturbing is that many people arent interested in verifying the sources  and a question like yours assumes you support that kind of behavior and is in denial of the truth but given the extent of hatred and division across the country  it is the question to ask goes against the agenda though there is another video circulating where a fruit seller appears to be licking his fingers as he rearranges fruits in his cart if

AMA,healthcare experts in an ama on low count of covid19 cases in india,2236,fqbie6,https://i.imgur.com/dII91mh.jpg,318,nan,zealofsingh, as physician working in a corporate hospital  ill clarify a few things as to why we are having fewer cases than expected 1 we are definitely testing less than other countries 2 the real spike is yet to be seen we may still have a surge of cases too early to say that we have less cases 3 we dont know what the reson is for lower virulence in indians a newly discovered mrna in indians might be protective  as can be lower levels of ace2 there are other countries like australia as well where they have very less mortality4 we really are in no position to handle a situation like new york or lombardyedit we have confirmed reports that some hospitals are hiding positive casesedit 2  the hospital has come out with a press release admitting that they indeed have 3 positive cases however  we have known it for atleast 3 days now they hid it from the media for atleast 3 days   maybe more i have a question though  lets say india didnt have 700 but 700 000 cases in realitynot testing would result in low count  but you would still have sudden surge in people reporting to hospitals wouldnt you?  or even sudden surge in deaths related to pneumonia i just think that if numbers were as big as some are claiming them to be  like in the 200k to 500k range we wouldve definitely seen a situation where our hospitals would be overloaded and it wouldve been difficult to hide that in a country like india for those who are thinking this is not true  i would say just waitfor those who are thinking we should do more tests   i wish india had capacity for itfor those who want india should have done better  india is still a poor nation now it would be getting worsefor those who are trying to give it a religion or political angle  fk you  removed  it has been noted and stated by many that india does lack testing facilities and with the current situation with migrant workers  the situation can definitely worsen it is only a matter of time presence of mangoes on a tree ensure that its a mango tree absence of mangoes does not mean that a tree is not a mango tree  cre  bee were acquiring herd immunity yall for once  i am feeling proud for our governments timely step i was thinking that we might be testing less than required but today i came across this article which gave a bit of solace  https  wwwindiaspendcom 1in50covid19testsinindiaarecomingoutpositivecomparedwith1in4initaly1in10intheuk they discuss the ratio of confirmed cases to total number of tests quoting from the articleindia tested 25 254 samples as of 8 pm on march 25  of which 581  23  were positive  according to the latest update from the indian council of medical research this proportion is comparable with south koreas  3  and higher than taiwans  1 in comparison  74 386 of 324 445 tests  23  in italy  6 001 of 35 995 tests  167  in austria  65 497 of 484 062 tests  135  in the us and 9 529 of 97 019 tests  10  in the uk were positivemore targeted testing in other countries could also be a reason for their higher percentages  removed  just being a negative nancy is she  pj lets not forget we indians dont like going to docters and prefer selfmedication pretty sure many people especially in age 2040 sitting home with virus keeping the mortality rate at 1  i would state that the real number is affected cases at the max could be 2 000 from the current near 1000 so were off by a factor of 2 death rate is more reliable than number of cases  for countries with democracy  death toll in india is currently 20 since its in initial stage in india  we can take mortality rate of 2 now after calculating we get roughly 1000 cases which is in line with currently 902 cases you can add 100 to 200 in 1000 cases but not more than that i believe that government is actively working on this problem  major decisions regarding converting schools in hospitals  railway coach into quarantine center  developing new methods of testing etcso we as indian need to contribute to the efforts of government in any way and manner we can just like rape in saudi arabia no report  no rapeno test  no coronago corona think about bangladesh then they are even more crowded than us i believe they are one of the most densely populated countries in the world havent heard much about covid from them though so india has 25 of hit rate on the testswhile other countries have 10and india has been denying tests to most who show uphow do we explain this? keyword may day 1 50 infected  day 2  those 50 infected 500 more   edit  r0 is not a constant 10 permanently  is an example  the numbers can vary based on precautions taken and communities may have higher or lower rates of spread and it may also mean r0 can rise day by day  or go down day by day please refer to the statistical data and feel free to calculate again if my example doesnt satisfy you reasoning behind using r0  10   the inadequate tests and spread rates that are partially evident  66 as mild symptoms  conservative side of 80 as on some sites once again kept r0 as 0  considering it is not contained and during incubation period one person can easily come in contact with atleast 1015 also there is an error it wont be day 2 for 500  day 2  incubation period started so should be day 4 or day 5 to get to 500 resulting in a possible 12 day delay in actual show of 50 to 500 6 days to spread  and 8 days for the spreaded to be in turn infected again i may have accidentally skipped any info please let me know in comments breakdown of those 500    66  300  show mild symptoms and their immunity kicks in and a fraction of them recover without even consulting a doctor  recovery period about 1 week with 1 week incubation period  aka 2 weeks of being a potential spreader   while some of them do get a few symptoms a fraction practises quarantine and some meds and gets better  never realizing they were infected with covid 19  most of this group     33  200  which will show symptoms and get worse progressively and more likely visit hospitals  even a small fraction of this will not get self treated and may recover or some may die  post mortem will they be classified as covid 19 death ? now the reports which we do know are covid 19 are an actual subset of this 200 people group  which will show up on radar approx 4 days after day 2  aka on day 6  due to eventually finding out  we also miss on a good chunk of the carriers who will not be tested and will add easily to the exponential growth  all the while the actual cases which are severe will be followed with a 45 day delay  which is enough to track down for maybe 50 cases but for 500 carriers not possible in absence of widespread testing  this can be visualized mathematically  easily remember to factor in the methods of verification of a positive case from the 10 actual infected  the carriers are least likely to be tested or quarantined also considering weather changes and other factors many of this symptoms  a common citizen  may  think of as weather change issue and not some corona virus infection that is taking root so true thats why kerala shows more cases as they check vigilantly,2020-03-28 15:56:50

AMA,i am an exmuslim ama,145,fw2u16,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fw2u16/i_am_an_exmuslim_ama/,259, hi  i am an inthecloset exmuslim whos deeply sympathetic to muslims in india as they are my friends and family i am also extremely critical of islam as an organized religion because it ruined my life and the life of others like myself  we have a fledgling subreddit  r indianexmuslims for others like us we are not antimuslim  we just dont believe islams claims and feel islam should be criticized like any other belief system  ask me anything,butcher1239, what are the attitudes among your friends family towards sunni  shia  sufi  ahmaddiya muslims? i love that there are two exmuslims answering all the questions i feel like were getting two amas in one post not complaining as a strong supporter of secular politics  at times its difficult to see certain farright attitude among the muslim brethren    how effective is rationalism in muslim community of india and what is its reach?        i also have come across a fair share of atrocities against dalits by the muslim community what is the attitude among muslims about dalits? while growing up  did you face any discrimination in schools  etc from your friends just because you were a muslim? how will your family and friends react when they find out you no longer identify as muslim? are you worried? being a minority  do muslim children get the feeling that theyre different from others  and maybe face difficulty adjusting? does this impact their mental well being  and if so  how do they get support? do children do better when theyre in a muslim majority school or a mixed school? what are some things you feel a lot of non muslims dont know about muslims like  is it really religion first for most of them? from a purely academic secular point of view  what do you think of hinduism? im mainly curious to understand how indian muslims in general perceive the majority religion i imagine most dont think much about it what is the attitude of your friends family towards the kashmir movement? do they support it but do not speak out because of fear? are they nationalistic? can you name some people  historical or present day  that muslims look up to or consider their role models? which exmuslim youtubers influenced you the most? for me its apostate prophet and abdullah sameer what do you think of the hijab? did your opinion of homosexuality change after you left islam? hi another exmuslim herei never felt discriminated against growing up even now the only discrimination i have felt is on toi comments and twitter the reason i left religion is because i felt i was living a lie i feel i should read up about other religions  especially hinduism and its rich culture how did you leave islam? was it a gradual journey or was there a eureka moment? did it affect you mentally? some of the dalit bahujan pages i follow talk about the ashrafsyed  upper caste  vs the pasmanda lower caste  muslims they talk about how the hindumuslim binary is created by brahmins and ashrafs to benefit themselves  and that the true source of conflict is not hindu vs muslim but brahminashraf vs bahujanpasmanda brahmins and ashrafs are the ones with wealth and influence within their communities  the people who give speeches  but it is the bahujan pasmandas  the working classes  that die in riots  while the brahmin ashrafs win seats in parliament the hindumuslim binary is useful in ending any caste class consciousness that may arise among bahujan pasmandas so my question is  how relevant is caste among indian muslims? is endogamy practiced in any form?  ive heard syeds used to only marry amongst themselves but now they marry other upper caste muslims as well  similar to how brahmins now marry baniyas as well is there an overlap between these caste groups and wealth income levels? why you left islam?  please mention the details as im studying the religion myself would be your kindest of  favors  d 1  what are you now? different religion? atheist? agnostic? antitheist?2  why did you leave islam? what caused all this?3  on the scale of just exmuslim and islam should be removed from the world  where are you?4  in your opinion  who are the popular muslim figures who should be despised criticized instead of being famous among muslims5  in your opinion  what are some big ills of muslim society6  what are your thoughts on the future of muslims world what are some aspects of islam that you really love?  deleted  me too exmuslim   hello there ,2020-04-07 06:53:33

AMA,ama announcement srinivas kodali  independent researcher who has been documenting the aadhaar project along with several other researchers his work made him file public interest litigation against the illegal voter deletions by eci using aadhaar and npr data ama on 25th december  6 pm ie today,261,efe1hj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/efe1hj/ama_announcement_srinivas_kodali_independent/,28,hello r india we will be hosting srinivas kodali in an ama today 6 pm he is an independent researcher who has been documenting the aadhaar project along with several other researchers his work made him file public interest litigation against the illegal voter deletions by eci using aadhaar and npr dataon our request  he sent us the following text explaining the significance of npr the national population register is a very old project whose pilot implementation dates back to 1986 in rural rajasthan the project came into the mainstream after the kargil war of 1999 when india realised it cant identify the foreigners from indians during a conference of chief ministers on internal security in 2001  the project was approved part of the project every indian was supposed to be distributed multi purpose national identity cards  which were essentially smart card with fingerprints stored in chip while this project was being piloted  india went through another attack on 26 11 08 in mumbai by pakistani terrorists posing as fishermen  this is the first time cards were started being distributed to fishermen and so on  but post 26 11  due to the heavy intelligence failures multiple other databases like natgrid  cctns  cms  aadhaar poppped up aadhaar project and npr were very similar so to deal with it  the cabinet combined both of them  the registar general of india became a registrar under uidai and started distributing aadhaar the deal was npr will get biometrics from uidai post deduplication  but the supreme court stopped all of this by ordering no biometrics will be shared with anyone  after all of this  npr project continued and was updated part of 2011 census and again in 2015 the project in itself is the start of national register of citizens npr data will be used to disclose a list of citizens and the ones not in it will be classified as foreign residentshis twitter https  twittercom digitalduttarecently he published an article on nrcnpraadhaar nexus on thewirein please feel free to go through it   digital india on steroids how aadhaar infra enables the npr and the nrc the npr is the mother database for a potential nrc  but it needs verification of biometrics from the uidai  https  thewirein tech aadhaarinfranprnrc please note that this is just the announcement thread the ama thread will be posted by the guest at the time of the ama questions posted here may go unnoticed by the guest,anonymouse_2001, many thanks to the mods for holding the recent amas this is very helpful in generating much needed engagement hi srinivas  in your tweet thread  https  twittercom digitaldutta status 1209029898695659521  https  twittercom digitaldutta status 1209029898695659521  you talked about bio metrics being deduplicated with uidai  can you explain what this means and why it is needed ? are you from swecha group? there was a news back in the year that aadhar data is not secure enoughand some french guy who also trolled trai chiefmy question is  if aadhar is not secure then why emphasize on connecting it to every other thing that is secure like my pan  my mobile number and even my bank deposits? there was an aadhar card for some dog i have seen it in 2018how? and why?how is it possible and why was it not caught by the authorities before issuing the same? in your opinion   will this npr nrc project result in gerrymandering like it happens in the us where parties draw and redraw constituency to favor the chances of their party winning ? thanks a lot for doing this my questions1 while npr is under citizenship act and census under census act  their data is being collected together can it be shared between the two? is there a possibility of npr data being used for delimitation given census datas privacy anonymity clause?  as you hinted this this tweet     https  twittercom digitaldutta status 1209030276698931201  https  twittercom digitaldutta status 1209030276698931201   2 how accurate are the ecs voter list purification exercises? do you know why do we have duplicates in voter list at all? or is it just an excuse to delete voters who might not vote in favour?3 given bjps multiple lies and delays about nrc and rules to implement caa  what do you think they really have in mind? how should the protesters go about it all? there are women in shaheen bagh who are sitting outside for many days now what should we aim to do here on and how do we do it? what is the difference between npr by upa and npr by present government? why is it more dangerous now? i have two questions 1  how do you think the govt should balance between privacy and security? both seem to be opposite to each other if the govt wants to grant its citizens some privacy  both online and offline   then that can pose a security threat as they wont be able to identify terrorists if the govt want to tighten up the security by monitoring data  online surveillance  and putting surveillance cameras everywhere  offline surveillance   then that becomes a privacy nightmare for a citizen of a democratic country so how should the govt balance privacy and security of its citizens?2  related to this  what do you think about data protection bill recently brought into the parliament? it feels like the govt is focussing more on the security aspect than privacy  in the context i explained above  the bill was supposed to give more privacy to citizens but it feels like the bill has gone in the opposite direction what are your thoughts on both these questions? how can this npr data along with aadhar can be used for winning elections as you pointed once in your thread? in your article  https  thewirein tech aadhaarinfranprnrc  https  thewirein tech aadhaarinfranprnrc  you conclude that the governments use of data to identify people and randomly create registries has created a multitude of problems it is time they be put in check with the upcoming data protection bill could you elaborate on what kinds of problems these are ?,2019-12-25 21:51:01
AMA,ama im from kashmir,126,dt1ark,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dt1ark/ama_im_from_kashmir/,255,hi a kashmiri here kashmir for the past 91 days has been under a lockdown and the government has no plans of giving the people any respite till deep winterthe seasons first snowfall was witnessed today and the administration refuses to clear the roads and get the electricity back on,bropunzal, did mods verify? basic question  how are you and your family? do you have more appreciation of internet after this episode? or has this forced digital detox  while highly inconvenient  made you appreciate offline life more friends  relatives  physical activity  hobbies? how true are the claims that there has been not a single bullet fired since the announcement was made?is it true that no childen have been detained by the police?are emergency medical facilities available?what is the situation on procuring the basic necessities like food materials?do you think that lifting the lockdown would result in violence? what can be done to diminish the unrest? how have kashmiris taken to the splitting of most of the state into ladakh  both in terms of impact it has on kashmiri identity and more day to day stuff like administration  jobs and economy? just curious as to what kashmiri locals think about genocide on pandits  ethnic cleansing  driving them out and looting their properties it is no secret that locals to some extent collaborated with the militants as they saw the violence beneficial do you agree that these murderers should be brought to justice similar to how nazi war criminals hiding were hunted down and brought to courts? would you and other kashmiris like kashmir to be like other indian states? by other indian states i mean no lockdown but also no special status what do kashmiris feel about the lockdown? why is gustaba served last? i read your another comment  and want to follow up on it youll understand the political sensitivity of the issue  but what can indian state do over time to make things better asking as this has to improve  indian state is investing so much money  lives are being lost  and no one is happy with anything hi  kashmiri here  not in kashmir  i dont have any questions to ask  just wanted to say that i hope that you are your family are doing well i see stuff on the news channels and im worried for my relatives there   firstly  thank you for doing this i have a couple acquaintances in the valley but havent been able to muster the courage to text them no words can comfort them i hope things get better sooni am curious about the healthcare situation there?earlier there were reports of life saving medicenes and critcal care equipment shortage is it any better now? also  how heavily is the military deployed there? as in are they at every street corner  every block? have they cut off neighborhoods from each other? what are your day to day interactions with them like? are they hostile towards the locals or indifferent?  deleted  salam dont want to ask you anything just want to say sorry as an indian and as a human beingi cant even begin to imagine what it mustve been like for you guys for the last three months i still  to this day  have not been able to contact my friends who live in an area called bren nishaat  if i recall correctly  in srinagar not even a simple text exchange to ask how they and their families are and that alone is a huge indicator of just how badly wrong things have gone may allah keep you safe and happy as a kashmiri  what is your personal preference? would you like kashmir to be with india  pakistan  or stay independent ?edit can you also share your religion for context?edit 2 what do other kashmiri feel about this? dapaan neth karen restore yakum decembar peth? beyi mah trayan rail ti yalle halaat che laegmet thoda  calm down gasni magar  meh basaan yi phaeri wapsi cxouri nai weryeh tohih kya basaan? what do kashmiris want? except for the removal of restrictions which i believe should happen asap and except reinstating 370 and 35a which the current government wont do? i dont want to get political but how as the sentiment changed towards the nation after the episode  you can ignore the question if you want just trying to understand what this has done in the minds of the people apart from the obvious i personally think kashmir should be made a independent entity with only foreign relations and defence being managed by the central government this is to counter the threats from pakistan and china this would also mean kashmiris only enjoy the same privileges in rest of india that rest of india has in kashmir do you think thatd be a better outcome for kashmir? tbh i havent seen a good argument for keeping article 370 yes it ended special privileges that kashmiris enjoyed but the article itself has been so diluted it was hardly doing much apart from an emotional reasoning what is it that kashmiris oppose in removal of art 370 assuming the lockdown didnt happen  cause that is terrible what are your thoughts on jammu and its people? i see people media mentioning about kashmir a lot  but nothing on jammu,2019-11-08 07:20:10

experiences,257,dh2foi,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dh2foi/my_experiences_and_tales_from_working_at/,99,  mcdonlads franchines began popping up in bombay around the mid 2000s one opened near where i lived at the time i was an engineering student at a decent bombay college and before the semester exams  id be studying at home my mom would force me to mop the floors and do the dishes youth makes most rebel against order and i did too i told my mom that id rather mop the floors at the nearby mcdonalds branch and be paid rather than do the same work at home for no pay she reluctantly let me try my luck but didnt have high hopesi proved her wrong and was quite smug about it all i did was to walk into the store a week after it opened  ask for the manager and explained that i was looking for a job he sat me down  explained the terms and did the expected song and dance i left my phone number with him and lo and behold  he called the next morning asking when i could begin i began the following morningmy tasks consisted of doing anything at the store with two exceptions i could not operate the fryer as you first had to pass a course and i could not do deliveries as i did not have a twowheeler license anything else was fair game and i manned the counter  served customers  cleaned toilets  manned the takeout counter and yes  mopped the floormy hours were 9 am  7 pm and the store opened at 10 am the first hour was spent preparing the store for the onslaught of the mcdonaldscraving indian junta many of whom were sinister vegetarians i say sinister because if these people had their way  they would crucify anyone who ate meat since they could not do this  they resorted to making a nuisance of themselves everywhere they went at home  they thought nothing of abusing the labour of a lowercaste servant and would force said servant to eat and drink from separate utensils anything that came into contact with a meateater was deemed to have been defiled and must be purified by magic incantations and ritual cleansing with water these same people once called the police because my family was cooking fish the irony of eating food at a restaurant that also served chicken was lost on them but thats partly because they love the gora and anything that the gora sells to themanyhow  once the doors opened at 10 am  the first wave of customers was invariably college students decent people but fairly docile they viewed mcdonalds servings as the quail and manna of the gods and would rarely complain if the food was substandard which it often was the evening mom crowd  though  was another story#half information is a dangerous thingone friday evening  i was at the counter when a wellfed gujurati lady walked up with her wellfed son they ordered a happy meal for the young meatball and a veggie burger and a coke for madam there is an internet rumour that chains like mcdonalds cheat customers on cocacola by including too much ice this is not entirely true the reality is that the syrup coming out of the machine is not entirely diluted and the ice is there for two reasons to keep the drink cold and to add water the woman was not aware of this and i served her drink with the standard halfcup of ice she walked away  found a table and took offence almost immediately to set the scene  lines when mcdonalds first opened in the bombay suburbs were fairly long and they only kept growing through the day this woman cuts to the front of the line and accuses me of cheating her with the coke i said that it was standard practice and even offered to replace her drink with another one she agreed but kept shouting that i was a cheater oki filled a new cup with the coke syrup from the machine and proceeded to add cold water from the fridge she started screaming at this point and demanded that i fill the cup with the syrup i acquiesced she walked away with a cup of sugary coke syrup one customer later  she was back and again shouted at me and accused me of cheating i said that i had done exactly as she has asked to which she replied is that how you talk to your mother and flung the contents of the cup at my faceindians have this disgusting and mistaken belief that if they pay for a service  they own the service staff anecdotally  this seems to be prevalent among the upper castes the manager appeared on the scene because of the commission and sided with the woman in india  the word of a woman is taken as gospel and the man is automatically the target of the ire of a lynch mob i was lucky that no violence was involved at the end of this scene  the front half of my body was a sticky  sugary mess and the woman walked away with a 1000 rupee voucher#beggarsmcdonalds have a food slide between the kitchen and the counters which is essentially an inclined  stainless steel chute with multiple lanes for food once placed  anything on the slide must be on a customers place within 90 seconds or it would be binned perfectly good food would be binned because it was getting cold i decided to do a good deed and found a clean bag into which i deposited food from the slide good burgers  plenty of fries and a smattering of other food once done for the day  i took this bag outside and began handing its contents out to the beggars on the street i was soon mobbed by several but had enough food to go around they seemed grateful but i did not know what was in storethe next morning  as soon as the shutters were raised  within literally seconds  about 100 beggars began banging on the glass window panes demanding food the manager was called and ashutosh was not pleased when it was revealed that i the naive was the culprit i still gathered the food but i took it to the local church and left it to them to distribute it#space hogsalthough it has chairs and tables  mcdonalds is a sitdown restaurant in the same way that bombay is a world class city this  however  would not deter our local business men  read thugs and politicians  from trying to hold business meetings in the restaurant one fine evening during the rush hour  we had a local politician from the congress show up  demand food and to the surprise of everyone there  actually pay for it he then took his entourage and demanded that seated customers pay obeisance to him by vacating their tables this being india  they complied and the man proceeded to have a 4 hour and 26 minute meeting there with a party of 24 people i know because we kept notes he paid for a big mac and a portion of fries#midnight in gujaratanyone whos lived near gujjus will know that many  many gujjus who run their own business have a tendency to eat dinner at 10 pm mcdonalds closed at 10 pm according to the signs but 2154 was when a torrent of potbellied gujju uncles with their puffedpoori wives and kids would line up outside the takeaway counter although the seating area was offlimits and the front door was closed  ashutosh would not say no to paying customers to these gujjus  the sliced buns of mcdonalds bread was like the parted waters of the red sea and i was their moses i was often stunned at how much these people ate im a skinny person and i could not eat more than two large mcdonalds burgers i once saw a man eat 4 in 5 minutes i worry for his arteries and his wifes hips#marathi manoos and the senafish was once served at our restaurant though it was soon taken off the menu after a group of angry nativists protested they showed up with the constabulary and orange flags  some with snarling tigers on them and demanded that we stop selling fish  which is apparently haram in staunch maharashtrian circles ashutosh caved and the offending piscean meat was removed another time  the cops showed up with booze and demanded food they did not pay but sat on the seats  drank and laughed like louts in the land of the poor  the police are the mafiain all  my experience with mcdonalds was decent i worked three months including most of my vacation i worked 12 hours most days and was paid 350 rupees for each days work with no overtime i worked 6 days a week but the restaurant was open all 7 days  9 am  11 pm for staff  customer hours were shorter  i had the distinct advantage of getting in early when the chain was new and had few employees i also had the advantage of speaking fairly decent english at a time when most employees did not if youre considering this as an option to make some money  things may have changed more recently i would not recommend eating mcdonalds food regularly even the church where i would deposit unused food asked that i stop brining any over they did not like it because it was oily and would not spoil  the latter causing much suspicion about the contents of the foodthese were my stories from my time there i have several more  if anyones interested feel free to ama about my experiences and thanks for reading,mcdonalds_bombay, one friday evening  i was at the counter when a wellfed gujurati lady walked up with her wellfed soni chuckled reading this   your writing style is superlative i just dont understand why would sena protest against selling fish and most definitely it is not considered haram in maharashtrian families maybe strictly vegetarian will not eat it but most nonveg marathi families eat fish the next morning  as soon as the shutters were raised  within literally seconds  about 100 beggars began banging on the glass window panes demanding foodbelieve me there used to be a time when people from inorbit  vashi could be seen dashing all the way to local station with their mcd coke to avoid beggars man this was an interesting sunday read thanks for sharing it here he paid for a big mac and a portion of friesyou dont get big mac in india right? is this fictional op or just a slip of tongue? peven if so  you do write very well  im impressed is what you do for a living related to writing? no questions here   but i thoroughly enjoyed your writeup and the humour have a great weekend  did you ever spit in someones food ?slim shady fake post something akin to a writers fantasy you said marathi people asked you to stop selling fishes in mumbai  i cannot believe that all half the mumbai marathi population is from konkan where fishes are staple mumbai itself has roots in a fishing village and shiv sena half of whom are from konkan themselves asking you to stop selling fish what bullshit i went to the mcdonalds outside vt station the day it opened it seemed super expensive back then the outside seating was great i received excellent service and i even filling out a feedback form why wont the foods get spoiled? some things that sound fake to me1 shiv sena opposing fish  like others have stated  shiv sena have never really had a stance opposing meat or beef  correct me if i am wrong  in fact  they had flouted government orders and sold meant fish when it was banned for jain festivals2 woman throws coke at employee and walks away with 1000 rs voucher  again  i can believe people being rude and still being placated by manager  but  an actual act of aggression like throwing drink at the guy in counter and getting away sounds farfetched i am not defending any caste here  but even people of lower caste treat people in retail shitty in india no one cares about respect for a fellow human  if they are paying you or buying your stuff you are their slave upper caste or lower caste  phd or 10th pass they all behave the same in this shit country this is darn funny usually well off kids in india dont do part time jobs  its sad  its because of the class perceptions but if anyone is interested  id suggest decathlon  they seem to be hiring mostly well off upper middle class college students wow was that interesting and funny1 how long does it take for the food to become inedible?2 what did you tell the beggars to make them go away?3 whats the biggest most disgusting order you ever served?4 did you ever come across someone having a heart attack medical issues in the restaurant?5 whats so difficult about operating the fryer?6 why did you take up engineering instead of writing books in mcdonalds? we could have had a desi hari patra by now please send me a invitation to your book launch  whenever it happens 7 isnt fish vegetarian?   i worked three monthswow so many bizarre experiences in such a short time? are there rats mouse in mcdonalds kitchen? not entirely sure if this is real but interesting read nonetheless  i once saw a man eat 4 in 5 minutes i worry for his arteries and his wifes hips      no meat was served at that branch? nuggets? mcchicken? what  if there are any the shady things mcdonalds or other fast food restaurants do with their food? one friday evening  i was at the counter when a wellfed gujurati lady walked up with her wellfed sonthats a classic karen story you should post this on r entitledparents i liked your style of writing  ,2019-10-13 12:37:41

a psychologist or a psychiatrist? everyday i think i am useless and their is no hope for me in future i am highly unproductive at job and on the verge of being fired i find it hard to mantain relationships its been long that i stopped living and now  just existing what did i do to deserve this i am no attention seeker excuse me if i seem to be one what should i do? what advice would you have for students who study in high intensity educational environments like kota and their parents? how do you check the status of your mental health? hey there   how do i explain a sense of emptyness in me i worked hard have good friends but end of the day i really still feel empty sometimes  dont get me wrong its not that i am always sad or something but its just feels there is no point in busting my ass to get to work or maintain relationships with friends or gf  also how can i help or do my part in ngo or help someone who is going though tough times cause some of my friends are relctunat to get help or visit a psychiatrist given that most people consider getting help from a professional as a taboo   my view and observation    also what are your thoughts about online therapist ? thank you appreciate the job you guys are doing do you think that staying in this country and its conditions  social  structural etc has an impact on our mental health besides the fact that there are no facilities that help with such mental health related issues what can be done to promote the awareness of mental health? we only tend to go to a therapist when things go out of control how do i find therapists in  india? all i see are psychologists or psychiatrists arent these the ppl who like to solve it via medicines instead of mental therapy? any updated panindia list of mental health professionals that you can share? how much of mental health research is happening in india? for some weird reason  mental health has not been given its due importance in this country  education as well as the medical condition what has your organization done to influence the policies of our nation towards educating and improving mental health? how should i breach the topic of rehab with a friend who is slipping into dangerous addiction? whats a movie that youve seen that addresses something mental health related  that handles the topic with the gravity that it deserves? a lot of media tends to make light talking about this kind of stuff ah  hes a mental person  send him to nimhans for context growing up  i always thought of nimhans as some kind of arkham asylumesque place with padded cells and free straitjacket on check in which made me hesitant to receive help from there  when i needed it  visited a psychiatrist for the first time yesterday lets see how it goes whats a decent plan of action for someone  young adult  who suspects himself to be on the autism spectrum? a lot of mental health symptoms match with general lethargy and sadness  which is really natural so my question is  just like there is a lot of content about how to diagnose depression anxiety from early symptoms  do you have a checklist or something to rule out depression anxiety?  like dude  just get more sunlight and proper diet  rest  have a plan and youre good to go i live in existential crisis as  a result i underperform in my field compared to my peers i have sever anxiety and stress issues i met a doctor who gave me some tablets and i didnt find them of any help do you have any suggestion? im a doctor just out of medical school i am really interested in psychiatry i just want to know how much stigma is still associated with mental health and has it decreased a lot compared to the olden days ? and what can you guys do to curb that stigma ? hey  you guys are doing good workwhat can be done about mental health awareness among the more poorer and or backward areas of the country? theres been an uptick in mental health awareness among the urban areas and the socioeconomically better off regions  but taboos and nonaccess to proper treatment run rampant still in other regions anything from neuroses to major psychoses like schizophrenia or depression are still left undiagnosed and untreated what is the way to go forward for alleviation and awareness? heyas a med prof  i would like to know how does your organization  team handle all the anti mental health and anti psychiatry viewpoints which are prevalant at large in our society? how do you handle the basic line said by these people that mental illnesses are just fraud and that these things can be healed with being strong etc? how do you handle the way people perceive medicines especially anti depressants? do you guys have the proper information and even importantly  the proper way to convey the myths regarding the medications which public has?and lastly  how do you add psychiatristd and psychologists to your team? what is their role in your organization and do you serve as a third party to direct patients towards them? is 4 hours of sleep healthy for a student?,2019-10-10 02:02:38

AMA,hi reddit  i am pratik sinha  cofounder of alt news  ask me anything,1073,ejes3k,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ejes3k/hi_reddit_i_am_pratik_sinha_cofounder_of_alt_news/,308, will continue the ama tomorrow  around 12 pm ist hello  i am pratik sinha  cofounder of alt news i worked as a software engineer for over a decade and a half  and now i am part of the alt news team that is trying to work on the issue of misinformation disinformation in india on twitter  i can be followed at  free_thinker  and alt news can be followed at  altnewsplease feel free to ask me questions about the issue of misinfo disinfo  about alt news  about what the social media platforms are doing  and more,frthnker, how does one join your team fulltime and parttime? what type of roles do you have? do you like to eat mangoes? whats your business model? in how many ways do you generate revenue? i suggest everyone listen to the episode fighting fake news in the seen and unseen podcast with amit verma i watched it and learnt a lot about you i want to thank you for the brilliant work you are doing such work requires a lot of personal sacrifices and im sure there are lacs who appreciate iti have only one questionwhat do you see as altnews biggest threat today? how can the average indian help you combat this? can you guys develop something like a browser extension which can automatically alert about a fake news page when visited for example  anti virus software indicate weather a web page has malicious links etc  removed  do you ever get threat calls by political parties for exposing fake news? you are doing all your work from ahmedabad how do you do verification of information in other cities when someone has to go physically to a place im sure many of us would be ready to volunteer our services in these cases do you keep records of who shares the most amount of fake news on twitter? would love to see a chart listing the top 25 fake news tweeters in india and share it on whatsapp in all my groups i have a feeling that m kishwar will top the charts if one is prepared pratik  do you believe in religion concept of an omnipotent higher power? hi pratik been a follower since alt news inception great work  big fani just wonder why alt news is not getting much popularity that it deserves hire a pr agency may be?thanks have you ever made a mistake? like not checking a fact or news properly and mislabeling it as false? how did you correct it? do you think social media platforms should remove content which fact checkers have deemed false? if yes  doesnt that put a lot of power in the hands of the factcheckers  who can then easily suppress opinions contrary to theirs? in essence  the question is who checks the factcheckers if no  what can we do to reduce fake news on social media  without taking away peoples right to free speech? yesterday i had a big argument on twitter less surprising  eh?  that altnews shows a bias on one side only  but i countered by saying most of the fake news is generated to favour one side of the table how would pratik convince people on that side that altnews is absolutely neutral and brutal when it comes to quashing misinformation disinformation? i want to contribute to altnews  but live outside india the funding page  via instamojo only accepts payment methods from india how else can i donate? how do you guys first determine that one piece of information might be fake?when determined how do you guys investigate the information further?is there one particular thing which is false but its belived to be true by majority which have amused you guys? can you tell us if during this current government the number of fake news against muslims has increased in the recent years or not? and if yes how could we tackle it heremy next question is  is there a troll army who sends islamophobic whastapp and twitter messages daily on behalf of bjp to make their front strong?editand you people are doing a good job for humanity profit or not the service you are doing with credibility you people have made in recent years is worth praise aapka aur zubair bhai ka bahot bahot dil se shukriya dhanyawad hi pratik     do you think checking whether a news article is fake can be automated in the near future  so that there can be a mobile app that moreorless does the job ? do you think the prevalence of fake news articles that we are seeing  which is being used by interested parties to shape their narrative  is the new normal in the political scenario from now on? if yes  is there a sustainable way to fight it? are you hopeful that our current liberal constitution will ultimately prevail over the fascist theocratic ideologies contesting it? in the age of post truth  busting fake informations are still worth it for the people?i havent see yet   any politicians or any celebrities apologize or regret for spreading fake newshow do you defend yourself from allegations that you are more anti bjp? hi pratik  i am just curious have you teamed with social media platforms to provide this as a service   also have they incorporated your tool within their platform?,2020-01-04 01:58:48

for example  would you be willing to give up the housing that you got if you get your old house back?5 should reservation for kashmiri pandits be withdrawn now?,contraryview, i know one but hes 20 ill try to contact his father one of my closest school friends is kp  but i dont think hes on reddithis entire family is very happy about the decision of course my ex gf was  but eh  we dont talk any more got another opinion from a friend answering as kashmiri pandit  kp  born in 1990  we lost our home  business  identity  culture  health and became refugee in our own country no amount of  compensation can make kps to go back because of one simple reason we lost trust in other community my generation has heard and read horror stories of migration and how our kashmiri brothers watched while we were butchered we dont know what future holds but exodus of my community will always be darkest chapter in the history of kashmir i dont know about others but i wont be able to ever go back its not to the point and emotions get in the way getting government assigned flats and houses is a good deal but it doesnt change the fact we lost our heritage and culturealso he suggested you google girja tickoo and satish tickoo and read our moon has blood clots kashmiri here  however  under 30  i will try to get someone to get your questions answered i asked someone who is kashmiri and above 30 years below is  his view i  think everyone has his view point one has to answer these questions today or tomorrow as these are the relevant questions we still do not understand our position yet and what government of india has decided for us are we still migrants or that tag has been removed from us ? the situation says wait and watch ama request rahul pandita kp was old enough to understand what was going on in 90s and young enough to say us his opinions remindme 1 day can we get anupam kher to do an ama? im 26 and from the kashmiri pandit community given my age  i agree that im not in the best position to answer ops questions but i can take a stab if theyre still interested but below are some general thoughts if anyones interestedmy parents were forced to leave kashmir in 198990 and move to a place at the other end of the country where i grew up they havent been back since  just briefly for a week on vacation to show me what its like about 15 years ago and its sad and terrible but  its possible to recognize the plight of kashmiri hindus that had their lives uprooted overnight 30 years ago while also recognizing that whats happening right now is upsetting  undemocratic and unconstitutional unfortunately  indians  and the kp community to a large degree  has been consumed by bloodlust and its fucking saddening whats worse  and i find bewildering  is how none from the kp community were in support of repealing 370 until modi showed up in 2014 and they realized this would be a way to unleash a fresh hell in kashmir under the garb of patriotism and unification  perhaps im projecting too much malice on to their intentions when i should chalk it up to stupidity and propaganda  i dont think the community itself stands to gain a lot from this the most honest analysis is that historically  a lot of parties  including those suffering the most today  fucked up but no one took ownership then and now its just spiraled out of control after how oppressive the indian government has been there you expect states to be reasonable actors in these situations and not stoop to the level of terrorists because either way  its the common person whos affected the most and  as things stand today  while the kashmiri hindus have been rehabilitated elsewhere to a reasonable degree  more than two generations of kashmiris who stayed in kashmir  primarily muslims and sikh  grew up in the worlds most militarized zone im extremely pessimistic about the situation i am quite certain that were living through the creation of another west bank here i am a kashmiri pandit  i turn 30 in a few months i know many kashmir pandits over 30  including my parents  grandparents  aunts  uncles1 i am of the opinion that kashmir will be violent in the short term extremist violence is common in kashmir  why should this situation be any different?2 we will never return to kashmir  outside of the occasional very short trip i have been to kashmir once in my life  despite my father begging me not to go  for my safety i had to see the place that haunts my entire family  at least once my father has been back once since the 1980s the handful of elderly relatives that remained are slowly dying off 3 our ancestral house was sold under duress while my family was in exile our neighbors are the onces who forced us to sell  under threat of violence the bones still exist  but it was turned into a shopping mall we wont return because well never feel safe 4 my family was not provided housing by the government of india we were privileged enough to pay for our own housing many family members settled in the delhi area and have done well for themselves since some family members  have moved to the us  dubai  singapore and elsewhere and have also done quite well for themselves i know that my family is not the kind of pandit youre asking the question about  but it is true that the kashmiri diaspora has very little incentive to come back as they have rather good lives outside of kashmir of course  those who are still refugees are different  but come on  kashmri pandits who have a modicum of success arent moving back to a remote valley with poor infrastructure and a majority of inhabitants that could want us dead at any moment 5 yes the reservation was an illintentioned policy that failed kashmiris and prevented the proper integration of kashmir with indiai am by no means a hindu nationalist and i think the indian government deserves plenty of blame for the situation in kashmir as well as the plight of kashmiri pandits  as does the pakistini government  and kashmiri muslims frankly  i think kashmiri pandits are beside the point in this discussion  because kashmiri muslims succeeded in exterminating our culture without anchoring to the homeland  there arent enough of us to carry it forward and those numbers continue to dwindle as we marry nonkashmiris in a generation or two  kashmiri pandits will cease to exist in any meaningful way and no policy will save that so policy making shouldnt consider our plightpolicy making should have considered our plight 30 years ago  but now its too late without internet and swarm of bharat ke garam naujawan in reddit i think i can see if no one turns up in past perspective from kashmiris were not well received by virath bharat ke veer on this sub  removed   removed ,2019-08-08 20:23:43

is it your full time job?3 also do you have some insider information that us plebs cant even fathom? finally im a ca student and have maintained a decent portfolio i have a few  many  questions for you 1 what reading material would you suggest to a young investor to get a grip of trading?2 i once lost 10k in an intra day trade havent dared to trade again how to get out of the fear?3 how to get a good grasp of trading in futures?4 do you use algo trading? if yes  how did you learn to code and what books have you read to be good at algo trading?5 how do you maintain your cool when you incur a big loss on a bad day? 6 can you tell us more about your daily lifestyle? your routine etc seems like you beat u risingsteam s allegation from the last year post that you were just a lucky orangutun i would like you to imagine a national coinflipping contest lets assume we get 225 million americans up tomorrow morning and we ask them all to wager a dollar they go out in the morning at sunrise  and they all call the flip of a coin if they call correctly  they win a dollar from those who called wrong each day the losers drop out  and on the subsequent day the stakes build as all previous winnings are put on the line after ten flips on ten mornings  there will be approximately 220 000 people in the united states who have correctly called ten flips in a row they each will have won a little over 1 000   now this group will probably start getting a little puffed up about this  human nature being what it is they may try to be modest  but at cocktail parties they will occasionally admit to attractive members of the opposite sex what their technique is  and what marvelous insights they bring to the field of flipping   assuming that the winners are getting the appropriate rewards from the losers  in another ten days we will have 215 people who have successfully called their coin flips 20 times in a row and who  by this exercise  each have turned one dollar into a little over 1 million 225 million would have been lost  225 million would have been won   by then  this group will really lose their heads they will probably write books on how i turned a dollar into a million in twenty days working thirty seconds a morning worse yet  theyll probably start jetting around the country attending seminars on efficient coinflipping and tackling skeptical professors with  if it cant be done  why are there 215 of us?   by then some business school professor will probably be rude enough to bring up the fact that if 225 million orangutans had engaged in a similar exercise  the results would be much the same  215 egotistical orangutans with 20 straight winning flips kudos on crossing 1cr on trading i have a couple of questions for you1 what got you into trading in the first place any insight into your background?2 what was the learning curve involvedhow did you reach where you are right now? can you break it up into the skills  and necessary sources  and other resources needed to start off? how did you start learning how can begginers learn to do this thanks for the ama 1 is this your full time job or you do it part time?2 how many days of the year you work in one year?3 how many hours you spend per day? how much capital do you need to start with to make investing your full time job ? so that one can live off the profits and doesnt need to do other jobs to earn a living whats your basic strategy  momentum trading   special situations ? also did you ever calculate your sharpe ratio congrats on hitting 1cr hope you make 10x out of it  congratulations wow do you recommend any book a beginner can get 1 do you hold stock positions for more than one day if the position is making loss on that day? 2 whats your average trade size? like  how many ril shares will you buy in one go before squaring it off?3 which sectors are your favourite? i burned my hands trying to stay invested in auto stock biggest loss amount? what are your most common trading instruments? do you think mutual funds is a good investment strategy ? between real estate and mutual funds which would you pick ? do you trade as an individual or have you set up an llc or something?  can you spill some secrets on how to win in intraday? ive made a few thousands trading but mostly i am holding long because i cant win consistently in intraday what strategy should i use? also  which ta tool is the best?

AMA,hi reddit im srinivas kodali  a independent researcher documenting on aadhaar and npr projects ask me anything  ,365,efg21t,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/efg21t/hi_reddit_im_srinivas_kodali_a_independent/,145,hey folks im srinivas kodali  i am an independent researcher working with various internet communities and campaigns i have been documenting aadhaar  npr and the associated databases in india for the past few years ask me anythingedit guys  i am ending the ama  but will hang around and post updates on r india over the coming months about npr,digitaldutta, on our request  srinivas sent us the following text explaining the significance of npr i had originally added this in the announcement post the national population register is a very old project whose pilot implementation dates back to 1986 in rural rajasthan the project came into the mainstream after the kargil war of 1999 when india realised it cant identify the foreigners from indians during a conference of chief ministers on internal security in 2001  the project was approved part of the project every indian was supposed to be distributed multi purpose national identity cards  which were essentially smart card with fingerprints stored in chip while this project was being piloted  india went through another attack on 26 11 08 in mumbai by pakistani terrorists posing as fishermen this is the first time cards were started being distributed to fishermen and so on but post 26 11  due to the heavy intelligence failures multiple other databases like natgrid  cctns  cms  aadhaar poppped up aadhaar project and npr were very similar so to deal with it  the cabinet combined both of them  the registar general of india became a registrar under uidai and started distributing aadhaar the deal was npr will get biometrics from uidai post deduplication  but the supreme court stopped all of this by ordering no biometrics will be shared with anyoneafter all of this  npr project continued and was updated part of 2011 census and again in 2015 the project in itself is the start of national register of citizens npr data will be used to disclose a list of citizens and the ones not in it will be classified as foreign residents when data is being college for the npr  do people have to submit documents for verification? lets clear the elephant in the room is npr as innocent as the government makes it sound? the kerala and wb govt has stopped working on the npr citing concerns that it will turn into nrc also does it actually take 8000crores to find this? what sorts of tools and software programs do you use for your research into nprs data sets? in your opinion  will this npr nrc project result in gerrymandering like it happens in the us where parties draw and redraw constituency to favor the chances of their party winning ? i have two questions 1  how do you think the govt should balance between privacy and security? both seem to be opposite to each other if the govt wants to grant its citizens some privacy  both online and offline   then that can pose a security threat as they wont be able to identify terrorists if the govt want to tighten up the security by monitoring data  online surveillance  and putting surveillance cameras everywhere  offline surveillance   then that becomes a privacy nightmare for a citizen of a democratic country so how should the govt balance privacy and security of its citizens?2  related to this  what do you think about data protection bill recently brought into the parliament? it feels like the govt is focussing more on the security aspect than privacy  in the context i explained above  the bill was supposed to give more privacy to citizens but it feels like the bill has gone in the opposite direction what are your thoughts on both these questions? thanks a lot for doing this my questions1 while npr is under citizenship act and census under census act  their data is being collected together can it be shared between the two? is there a possibility of npr data being used for delimitation given census datas privacy anonymity clause?  as you hinted this this tweet     https  twittercom digitaldutta status 1209030276698931201  https  twittercom digitaldutta status 1209030276698931201   2 how accurate are the ecs voter list purification exercises? do you know why do we have duplicates in voter list at all? or is it just an excuse to delete voters who might not vote in favour?3 given bjps multiple lies and delays about nrc and rules to implement caa  what do you think they really have in mind? how should the protesters go about it all? there are women in shaheen bagh who are sitting outside for many days now what should we aim to do here on and how do we do it? what if i refuse to give my data?? hola any plans to anthologize the years of work you have put into this? amazing work safeguarding knowledge more people need to know about that tooalso  your knowledge of the city  hyderabad  is something you should share with us    how can this npr data along with aadhar can be used for winning elections as you pointed once in your thread? is the npr+nrc designed in a way that people are citizens by default  unless a sarkari babu handpicks individuals and families as they wish and issues a notice to them about their doubtfull citizenship status this way  are the majority population not harassed by the nprnrc exercise ? are we leaving this extremely delicate problem of deciding citizenship of an entire family under the hands of these random babus  which may or may not be employed by the bjp rss base to target specifically the muslims?  how do you ensure the data entered is legit? since from what i read there is no furnishing of proof or any verification as such what if i only provide 2 details my aadhar detail and birth certificate and refuse to give pan  voter  passport  dl? hi srinivas  thanks for doing it you say that at this point census and npr are practically the same but i think their primary difference comes from the act rules they come under isnt it true that the census data is supposed to be confidential and anonymized but the data collected under npr  which is a broader set now anyway  can be tied to an individual and will also be made public  for nrc objections ? so is it true that npr has no direct connection with nrc? in your article  https  thewirein tech aadhaarinfranprnrc  https  thewirein tech aadhaarinfranprnrc  you conclude that the governments use of data to identify people and randomly create registries has created a multitude of problems it is time they be put in check with the upcoming data protection bill could you elaborate on what kinds of problems these are ? also  i saw news reports which said that if you have given biometrics to uidai  you need not give them to npr then prakash javdekar said that no biometrics will be taken by npr does that mean uidai will give biometrics to npr? isnt that a violation of the aadhar act? in what ways is the npr different from the census? trying to see this from the governments point of view what safeguards does it have that people will give accurate data if they are not compelled to give documents? i understand that the nrc will be culled from the npr after verification of documents isnt this ridiculously inefficient? why not verify at the npr stage itself? hi s kwhat do you see is the role of state level  govt databases  given many of them use an architecture based on aadhaar seeding and link to npr  at least on paper ?do you think there could be a issue of decentralised action from sympathetic state level agencies using such data even if nrc doesnt materialise everywhere from the union govt? what do you think about all the issues raised in r antiaadhar subreddit and privacy issues like  this revealing phone numbers and family info  https  twittercom fs0c131y status 1023182584992473088?langen  bank info etc also gov saying aadhar not proof of citizenship as it can be made by any citizen for 500rs,2019-12-26 02:09:42

what do you think is your best trait?any instances where youve felt lonely? how did you deal with it?  hum kaale hain toh kya hua  apna time ayega get an escort ? there shouldnt be any taboo since we are all spending money for company  in one way or another  one of my earlier rejection storiesafter finishing engineering  i had to be at home for almost 25 years before i got the offer letter almost everyone who got hired with me  had their jobs delayed  this was like 15 years back anyways  i was really excited about the job and i was in training where i saw this beautiful lady in the same class i had this instant crush  but no balls to walk up to her to talk i did not really know it was called as dating  but you would just ask them for coffee at ccd and it meant that only or you would write a letter and give them so  training was for 3 months and 25 months had already passed once training is done  you can be posted anywhere also  back then i used to be enthusiastic at trying atleast lol at that day when the class finished  i walked behind her and said excuse me which she didnt hear  or pretended to not to hear  i had to repeat and shout a little  when she stopped she looked back and making an annoyed expression of what do you want at this point  mera poora phat gaya tha for couple of seconds  i didnt know what to say i stammered and said something like do you want to have coffee she got so angry and threw her water bottle at me i have no idea why she did that then she said  do you even know who i am etc etc and asked me to get lost thats it next two days  i avoided my training classes  which were mandatory  later  training finished and i never saw her againcan share more  but my comments are not appearing did you ever take any steps to improve yourself to better sell yourself or put yourself out there? why didnt you do a quick bangkok trip? dude  i feel for you im just like you too m  33  textbook virgin never hand held any girl kissing a girl is in my bucket list have been too coward  poor and clueless to afford high class  safe  hooker my parents have given up on me long ago and all my younger siblings are married now  whats the point of having an ama if you dont answer any of the questions?  i think you should get a dog for now who knows what the future might hold maybe the good boi could become your wingman its ok dude marriage is not everything in your life save enough for your retirement and have emergency funds focus on increasing your networth and enjoy your bachelorhood  am posting this without reading any of the other comments theres two options you got1 if you must  find someone who nobody else wants to marry a nice human being who would appreciate you for who you are a widow or a differently abled person and you may find love 2 focus on your career and making  saving  and investing as much money as you can and health of course then fuck bitches and whores  budget for it  the second option is my recommendation relationships are overrated  dont get into one and for fucks sake dont make little people fuck that shit  live for yourself building great friendships is more satisfying and fulfilling than chasing shitty ass romantic relationships and learn to rock that shit  not everybody is handsome and attractive with the right attitude  you can make ugly awesome i would rather have an ugly but awesome friend than hang out with a handsome looking asshole#x200b #x200b #x200b #x200b  i think your parents social connection are weak  because there are many girls like you who desperately wants to marry someone and initiate normal family life  its that you dont have reach to them  socially  the standard get rich go to gym suggestions are silly if that was the case more than half the men wouldnt get laid i suggest the following1 this is also a failure of your social circle  your friends and family change who you hangout with make new friends they have a responsibility to help you  remind them2 most of my relationships started in activites badminton  board games  book clubs  cooking lessons etc find some activities and slowly improve your social skills even if there are only guys  they have friends and sisters theyll hook you up with3 change your location i dont know where you currently are but its clearly not your destined place move to goa or himachal or a big city or even a different part of your current city  deleted  you can go for hookers but the stds are scary though not to offend you  butwhat do you think is unattractive about you? is it your physique  your expectations  or are you just ugly?  again  as a not so good looking guy i want to empathize your struggles and maybe share how you can improve what specific actions did you take to become desirable? like did you start hitting the gym  wearing good clothes  being confident etc ?im 100 sure you cant be that repulsive   unless you have a physical disabilitystill its not 100 impossible  i would say maybe your standards are too high? not to be condescending  because im going down this road and i think we should try to change our lives for the better   have u hit the gym to look fitter? have you clothed smartly to show nice personality? have you given helping hand to someone in need? have you tried being part of office parties?if answer to all these is yes  sanyaas le lo  kuch nahi honewalaif answer is no  your parents shouldve belted your ass when rejections started coming in  i gave upwhy so many rejections? have you objectively analysed? 1  are you     were you ever  interested in finding someone? 2 did you ever like somebody and actually approached them?  i am afraid i am seeing myself in you but how do you hold up with your collegues? do they also ignore disrespect avoid you?do you feel dumb sometimes because of not being able to hold conversations? i like how so many people are suggesting trips to amsterdam or bangkok or sex workers as if op asked for advice on how to get sex ,2019-03-03 21:53:36

AMA,namaste  india you might remember me from my im a pakistani ama here 7 months ago can we talk about war?,104,av9i7f,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/av9i7f/namaste_india_you_might_remember_me_from_my_im_a/,75,namastay  dostoi did an ama here a while ago you can  read it here  https  wwwredditcom r india comments 8w1kbb hi_india_im_a_pakistani_ama  it was honestly one of the most moving experiences of my life people started off slightly aggressive  with downvotes and sarcasm  but by the end we were all laughing about saalans in icecream dabbas  sharma jee ka beta mentality  newspaper liners in drawers  and swapping music and moviesim so sad about the tragedies going on at our borders right now to me  an indian life lost is as big a travesty as a pakistani life lost  and i know my pakistani friends feel the samehamari zubaan ek hai  rang ek hai  libas ek hai  aur ham ek waqt par ek hee hotay thay just because you say dibba and i say dabba doesnt mean we cant get alongi just wanted to ask my indian dost how you guys feel about whats happening  and wondering if theres anything the people  you and i  can do to make things better?this is a time for dialogue and friendship and acceptance lets not let stupidity and fear and anger ruin what weve been trying to createplease talk to me  and tell me your points of viewlove you guysdhanyawaad,WhereIsLordBeric, it warms my heart to see your kind messagepeople from both counties need to not respond to hate with hate this doesnt mean that either side becomes a doormat definitely not but i find it sad to see people take pride in the attack or retaliation the loss of life is never something to take pride in or rejoice fori think it is important for us indians to keep in mind that the terrible attack was by terrorists and extremists and not every pakistani that most of the people of pakistan condemn the act for this  it would help if pakistanis could openly vocally condemn too it will really help matters if there is interaction between our communities a lot of the distrust is out of ignorance  out of just not knowing better it is understandable given our histories and excusable if it hasnt done genuine harm people have been fed incorrect data on the other nation and nothing but more awareness  more truth can fix this most importantly  i would like to mention is that im indian and we say dabba at home i did not go through the previous ama so if it was acknowledged that some indians do say dabba and dibba is just much more common then forgive me for bringing it up again edit i realize i havent asked a question here but i am looking to discuss ways to control the situation also i did want to ask about how its portrayed by pakistani news but someone already did  im scared i have no clue how any of this is going to play out  i hope to god that this is just for the election and both sides will de escalate soon but im honestly worried i might get draftedmaybe im paranoid  but were talking about a possible nuclear war what scares me most is how indians seem to be reacting to the new if the strikes i dont understand how people can be celebrating sending a missile into another country yeah sure it was terror camps  but we shouldnt celebrate that we should do it with reluctance war is the last refuge of the incompetent it shouldnt be worshipped i was talking to one of my friends last night and as she was going she said main sone chali neend mein thode pakistani maarne hai i was shocked and offended so badly how someone so young   im 19 shes 18   can have some much hatred i get the anger that pakistan might house terrorists and its a matter of concern for both of the countries later on i ended up arguing and saying that people like her is why war comes into the picturebut i see so many people with so much hatred towards innocent people who just have no hatred towards our country it makes me feel sad im grateful there people like you who try to resolve and talk things rationally instead of going berserk and spreading hateive seen enough documentaries and talked to enough american war veterans to know how bad and traumatic war is id never wish something like this upon any of the countriesi just hope all of this ends soon and no more lives are lost thank you for your efforts peace  elections are coming  they will end and so will all the chaos day by day i am becoming a big fan of reddit in this time of tension its heartening to see a discussion happening rather than abusing each other i am not in fb as its extremely toxic and in twitter also people are baying for each others blood war is a lose lose situation for both the countries  hope pakistani army will follow the geneva convention and send our brave pilot safe and sound and peace will prevail again whatever this is  this is made to look as an immediate response to a heinous attack on indian soil through terror camps based out of pakistan it is a show of power  and it is something that has deep political implications because the elections are coming the only big news is that munitions were actually dropped in another country indian jets have crossed pakistani airspace for a while now but it was for surveillance only  this show of force isnt going to do anything because in the end the isi military will be do what they have always done  send terrorists in with their blessings your governments have always been a puppet of the isi the utter humiliation of 1971 is not something anyone in the military has forgotten  nor will they ever forget and kashmir is just a playground for the proxy war and that is about it in the end  the citizens will suffer both sides of the border and jingoism will continue in the end let us all agree that mutton biriyani is the best  and veg biriyani should be nuked   removed  politics  attacks etc may happen  but there is no need to hate a common pakistani citizen staying in lahore or karachi who is busy minding his own job i know we have these issues they need to be solved mutually till then  you guys keep on producing music we are producing our movies out of our hands really morons outnumber on both sides  welcome bhaiour leaders need sense  theres absolutely no need for people to die  not indian  not pakistani  at the end of the day were all in this big messy world together  this is so unnecessaryyes  love you guys tooan indian hi  can you help me understand why some pakistanis are upset due to indian army shooting down terrorist camp no civilian was harmed  no armyman was killed  so why the hate ?and i have to say this  india  pakistan is temporary  chicken biryani is forever lets not let stupidity and fear and anger ruin what weve been trying to createits because elections are coming this was the easiest and predicted way to cover up failure in governance hence this is the last refuge of any scoundrel who is in power hitler did it  stalin did it  gaddaffi and saddam both did it to earn peoples misguided belief this can never happen in first world countries  knowing fully well people are smarter than a 5th grader which both our countries lack and the bullshit will be called off regarding what caused it both our governments are friends in the background and know each others tastebuds  but like any actors job they have to act like enemies for profitin the un  both our countries ranks horribly in terms of basic human issues and aspects thats why this is what the government has to offer to us sell patriotism and to create that a bloody game of hate and carnage the lucky ones are those from both our countries are those people who quit and settled down in first world countries for better lives and they get to fuel hatred by means of spending money and few comments meanwhile they share drinks and bang chicks and laugh in those first world countries tell both of us how stupid we are to fall for thisus indians always puts a poor man down under the sewage to clean and remove poop and toxics without protection and we talk about injustice and revenge? please why does your army have a chokehold over the civilian government? since last time we met gloria jeanss outlet came up dude do you live in a major city? have you tried imagining what a mushroom cloud will look like? i live in karachi and was thinking of what it would look like and if i would see it in the distance before it hits me i dont want war i dont want people to die but it seems inevitable now the nut cases have taken over the government and they will take us to war for their greed and pride maybe increased  tourism can help bring down the ignorance this next  one is never going to happen thanks to terrorism  but linent visa and property   land owning laws between the countries  this will decrease the partition hate because both countries feel something was taken away from them forever my 2 chwanis on why we hate each otherpakistan army controls everything even elected govt  to maintain   justify this control they need masses in fear of attack from a  strong and evil enemy india  when ever we have a major festival or celebration or any happy time theres always an terrorist attack sometimes its busted sometimes they are successful  they chant allah hu akhbar while killing civilians and the organization which claims the attack is always based operating from inside pakistan  point blank  can pak  military establishment isi or govt  live without kashmir? if not then theres nothing to discuss  paks one point agenda has always been the piece of land  if they werent so dishonest about it the bloodshed of last 7 decades couldve been avoided india will not  cannot give up on kashmir  so thats the bottom linelastly good morning  evening?  to you  in whichever part of the world you are atm i think you should educate all your fellow citizens to not support terrorism and vote for a government that  doesnt support terrorism  i know many of you all are peace loving people   but you people should also take a stand against your government  removed ,2019-02-27 18:36:43

 gurudev  saturday wedding crasher here  give your ashirwad so that i reach half of that my base is kaushambi ghaziabad delhi ncr do you provide a service where you can replace me in the weddings i have to go to? what was your plan b? whats your motivation?  what kind of weddings did your gang usually target? big ones or small ones? hindu ones or muslim ones?did you do any kind of homework before attacking  like what to wear  whom to shake hands with  learn what their names are? did you ever run into someone you knew at any one of those weddings? randia wants to know how big are indian weddings? how many people in average? did you sing mein to ainvayi ainvayi e lut gaya narrate the scene of you gate crashing a wedding from the start ive hit almost half your amount your post makes me feel this like an accomplishment well  in hyderabad  people actually dont care if you gate crash a wedding   usually there is way too much food  and we hyderabads are generous about food op   what is your favourite function hall? was there a time when you got caught but still the host invited you for free food?also tell me about a bad experience you encountered sir hum science ki taraf se hain 1969?lootera unkill  summer of 69?you mean 1969? although im late to the party  as a former pro wedding crasher let me slide in some pro tips too1 the most difficult thing for first timers is to get in  especially when you see family members or relatives at the entrance the best thing to do now is to put your phone on flight mode and start talking on the phone while walking towards the entrance my usual conversation would be to an imaginary friend who is also coming to the party and is getting late take pauses  smile  as him his location etc etc 99 times out of 100 no one will bother you2 there have been weddings where i reached at 8 and they didnt start the food till 9 dont be an asshole who keeps eating every starter in a thin crowd eat like a gentleman be specific in requests be picky  rich people are picky  ask for nothing less than black dog or chivas regal  at the bar  or blenders pride if it is a gareeb shadi of people pretending to be rich show the waiter you belong best course of action is to take some thing and peacefully sit where all the aunties are and enjoy the performance on the stage  if there is any  till the food starts  all this was for 5 star hotel  farm house wedding crashes  3 be dapper if you think your clothing is just good enough  youll not be so confident be the best not just good enough confidence is key guys and it comes from your clothes 4 youll see the where the hottest looking aunties and their dropdead gorgeous daughters  who are  unfortunately  also dressed in their best dont fucking look at them  either at the mother or the daughter dont make them uncomfortable just admire once and move on accepting the fact that you will never get them eat and leave 5 if you are at the wedding with a friend never do meta level talks of how cool that you both did this talk about movies  assignments  netflix etc no meta6 if the cameraman is coming to you while you are at it  dont be sacred smile for the camera no one fucking cares 7 at muslim weddings there can be separate eating areas for men and women dont go to the womens area please8 if you cant hold your liquor  dont drink9 you can do this i had a tamil friend who couldnt speak a word of hindi who used do this with me he fucking used to for the extra kick of going to the bride and groom and congratulating them in heavily accented english in the capital of up so if he can  you can too 10 if you are married  you have nothing to fear nothing take your wife to weddings with pride no one will touch you no one you sound like my aunt but she used us we were kids  are a great prop  arent andhra telengana weddings mostly veg? when i am in college i go to whoever wedding is happing in city no body ask you me and my friends never got caught in hyderabad theres a joke that when questioned  a gate crasher said he was from the grooms side it was a childs circumcision party  mr nograj from the principals office would like to speak with youhttps  youtube jim3tjecx8,2018-05-17 03:01:26

AMA,hi  im hari  cofounder of pickyourtrail  ama,85,a15d5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a15d5x/hi_im_hari_cofounder_of_pickyourtrail_ama/,64,pickyourtrail is the worlds first diy online vacation platform using pyt  you can create  customise and book international trips  right from the comfort of your couch over the years  we have helped 10000+ travellers plan and experience their dream vacation our nps score is 72 and we are super hawkish on customer experience we were recently awarded the startup of the year award by tie and travel tech startup winner by ficci  govt of india  coincidentally  we are also celebrating 5 years of pickyourtrail today looking forward to the conversations  update  thanks for the super engaging session folks if there is any more q pls do post and i will answer later in the day tomorrow do follow me on twitter   https  twittercom haripyt  https  twittercom haripyt  and we can continue the convo there as well ,hari_ganapathy, a stupid questionhow is your service better different from thomas cook sotc balmerlaurie ? how many times were you close to bankruptcy? when you are bootstrapped how do you decide salary for founders? saw your website and really liked the interface tried planning a euro trip and my questions are based on that relative experience1 am i right in saying that your website does not sell pre packaged travel packages rather it gives the user an option to select from within the preselected vendor options to customise their tour? so essentially you are a marketplace of vendors with a travel layer on top to facilitate bookings?2 your website helps customise an itinerary but optimising the itinerary is still missing anything you are doing to fix that?3 i tried creating an account but your website seems content to let me plan without creating an account which is good but created an itinerary and wanted to save it by logging in and couldnt do that?4 if i directly get in touch with your travel experts to help me create an itinerary will they charge me for thatsorry didnt find that info anywhere? 1 what was your toughest customer service experience?2 what about backpacking options when visiting a country? for example  exploring areas that are not touristy or somewhat secluded3 what are your views on legalizing marijuana in india? would it change tourism sector in any way and would it change your list of offerings?4 lets say a tourist is caught for some illegal activity or a tourist loses their passport how do you handle such unforeseen circumstances? i am very impressed with the website so i decided to see how it works and looked for newzeland as an option and next day onwards i am being called by your representative i received already 3 calls 1 sms and 1 email  hello as someone who has used this service  i have had a mixed experience its a really nice concept to choose the activities and opt out of the things which doesnt seem to interest the individualwe have had hiccups during the trip planning and the trip these could have been better  especially the communication with the overseas partners as well as the visa agents and the ones from pyt who was managing our trip  this was resolved after escalations and the agent was changed  also someone was supposed to get back to me regarding an issue but then forgot to  as this was post the vacation i would have had a better opinion if the person followed through on this than leaving itanyways  my first international vacation was through you guys and i will always remember the good and the bad suggestion  improve the collection of preset activities  what is the motivation behind this project? also  how did you get your first paying customers?  deleted   deleted   deleted  any job openings?  are you hiring for digital marketing? did the ama finish?  removed  what are the payment options? do you support national travel? are you planning to in future? one thing that bugs me about travel agencies in general is that none of them are upfront about where they get their margins from if an agent tells me  up front  that this is the itemized bill for your itinerary  plus this is my x profit  id gladly pay up  if i can verify that the items in the bill match whatever i see on  bookingcom  https  bookingcom  or  hotelscom  https  hotelscom  or whereverotoh if an agent doesnt reveal this  i have no visibility on how much  and where  the travel agent is making his money  leading to the suspicion that i am being ripped off at every point and if i have to constantly doublecheck his rates  i might as well do the same thing myselfi and my family of 4 have made four international trips  two in asia  two in western europe  over the last 9 years  and for the last european vacation we did all the research online booking visas ourselves it was an exhasting time consuming process  and i would have gladly paid extra for a trustworthy agent hi hari  i am om how do you do? just checked the site and did some planning for trips that i have already done and your costs are pretty decent to be honest only thing that i would like to ask is how do you handle situation where someone faces some issue with the hotel   where its your clients word against the hotel? and how will u arrange for a hotel in middle of night if the client does not wnat to stay and wants to change the hotel becuase of some valid reason this is most important becuase even  single ruined night will ruin the next few days of tge trip and also your repeat business hi hari  congratulations on accomplishing this huge milestone i didnt know you guys were that old    my questions can you regale a story anecdote incident  from a customers perspective  on how smooth the said pyt customer experience is? how has your perspective on personalization and customer experience changed from day 0 till today? what plans for the future? what should pyt customers should be excited about? hey this is the first time ive heard about the website had a look and it looks quite neat how much of your traffic pick from the available packages and how much is custom plans?whats an upcoming destination request that you get the most in the last year?,2018-11-29 00:55:29
AMA,hey reddit  im dhruv rathee  youtuber and activist ama,368,84dbn1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/84dbn1/hey_reddit_im_dhruv_rathee_youtuber_and_activist/,344,i make videos on various social  political and trending issues facing our country ive also featured on many mirror now debates on live tv and been a regular writer on some leading publications like theprint  link to channel https  wwwyoutubecom dhruvratheemost of you may know me from the latest video on the bjp it cell interview that went viral ask me anything ill try to answer as many as possible in the next one hour if not  surely  by next week because i got my master thesis presentation day after tomorrow  yes  am also a student d  ,dhruvrathee, hi dhruv  no questions just wanted to say that your youtube channel is like an island of sanity in the digital sea of misinformation it really separates truth from fiction for a lot of people  i suggest you to please make a video on  legalization of foreign funding retrospectively from 1976  https  twittercom memeghnad status 973815913014267904   and the mechanisms used by the bjp for passing it the word needs to get out to more people  best of luck do you talk about religious superstitions  homeopathy and general pseudoscience? we need more people wholl promote science in these times where pseudoscience is taking the front seat if you dont tackle these type of issues  do you wish to do so in the future? when you make youtube videos do you think you are reaching an audience that is different from maybe those who hear soundcloud or read blogs? just wanted to say one of my bhakt friends from maheshwari community has become more rational ever since he started watching your videos he is more receptive to you because he thinks you are from his caste community this may sound silly to a lot of urban and younger randians  but thats the truth for small town india and i think it would be an effective way to reach out to similarly conservative communities across the country  deleted  what was ur inspiration to start doing what u do? will you ever consider doing videos in english? i know your majority audience is hindi but consider making maybe one video in english once every one two months and see how the response works out for you i understand hindi with great difficulty but regularly follow your content because there is no other place where i can find this stuff in the form of video content this year is going to be very interesting for indian politics and you can really help making the public more informed about their government thanks for doing the ama and creating the channel hey dhruv  are you single?       hi  couple of questions for you do you think the democratic process of voting for pm of india needs to be revamped? would it be better if people voted directly for the pm    la presidential systems in western countries? if so  then should states contributing more to the national gdp be given more votes? your thoughts on the upcoming 2019 elections? also where did the opposition falter and what does it need to fix to put up a fight in 2019? what are your hobbies apart from being a youtube activist?  also  what are your future plans? hi dhruv  most of the people who have been brainwashed by rss propaganda never accept any view other than they have been told over the years even if you give facts and good resources they still believe in whatsapp forwards like gandhi created pakistan  nehru was muslim etc what is your view on this and how to change their misbeliefs? hey  dhruv i dont have any political agendas as of now  but i have a few questions 1 as an 18 year old  that as of now has no trust over either of the fronts nda and upa  in the nation  what should he look for in the future? are there any new emerging fronts that might deserve our trust? i just hope that kejriwal gets more experience and trust and becomes the leader for this nation  in next 510 years 2 afaik  people around me mostly middle class  are not at all enthused or interested in the political circumstances of the country they just want to be safe  and be happy they have that chal rha hai toh chalne do  bas shanti se jeene do attitude i have that too 3 as an atheist and one that is critical of caste system i was a born in a brahmin family and none of us are castist   should i be fearful given that things are going backwards in the country  keeping in mind the future that has been planned out? in this period of sellout media youve been a much needed voice  keep up the good work dhruv  edit thanks for doing this ama too have you done any video articles where you praise sanghis or lambasted the congress or the opposition ? i felt your interview with a aap minister was too deferential  though i like the civility of it tbh  so doubts can be raised about your impartiality that you dont hold all politicians to the same standard side note i like the anti government stance here  except with seemingly random downvoting of bjp critical posts before some critical elections when it cells have the funds to hire extra staff  but i dont want this place to become critical of bjp all the time  and by extension apologists for aap congress  will you be interested in making a video on corrupt practises in delhi police? i might have some content  please read and make a video about essar tapes everyone has forgotten about them because media didnt make an issue out of it  i saw  this  https  wwwyoutubecom watch?vkesk8wk1uwm  video of yours regarding bitcoin its probably the best explanation in hindi for a layman but  why did u promote zebpay in between? there are so many other good exchanges found at wwwbitcoinratesin  not to mention  wwwlocalbitcoinscom is the best of them all  which is aligned with bitcoins ideology of decentralization  deleted  i watched the it cell video and wondered how come the it cell doesnt target ur videos i mean  the number of dislikes on ur videos arent as many as there should be because the it cell seems so huge this is a genuine doubt how you got hold of this it cell guy? also i feel like you are little bit biased towards congress id prefer if you avoid it it will discredit you are you not worried about getting rekt by this it cell? also last thing can you plz put a eth donation address here or on yt keep up the good work thanksps i am not paid to post this by hush hush partyedit changed some words hey  thanks for the ama i found your channel after watching the unacademy videos that you were in and was surprised to see so many bhakts in the comment sectionso here are my questions 1 i know that you have made several videos on the propaganda news channels  the facts there cannot be more true   but can you tell me some printed news media that are unbiased that i can rely on for news without getting pasted by propaganda and pseudo development goals?2 the most common question here how do you deal with all the death threats and are you your parents targeted recognised in any way when you are in india?3 which political party do you think will be best for india 20 years down the line and what party will die out assuming that similar trends continues that are happening now?4 while there are many ways but what is the best way i can trigger a bhakt?5 will you make videos on topics that are not political but deals with burning issues?randia thinks that your tweet about this ama can bring bjp it cell here i think they will be overwhelmed by the interface love your videos man goodluck with the presentation also  flair inspired by that video,2018-03-15 02:51:23

 since many of us here have been following and opposing aadhaar from its very beginning   i think we are now at the cusp of its final road where it could go either way so my question in general is 1  if the judgement does in comes favor of the petitioners   and aadhaar is scarped   or limited   what would be the govts reaction ? can they make new pillars through parliament to strengthen it?2  if the judgement comes in favor of govt   what should be our next course of action ? i for one and many here and on other forums havent enrolled for aadhaar   so should be our next move   still wait out or enroll after sc judgement?thanks in advance for your participation here on reddit  to the lawyers on the panelif there is proof that a citizens aadhar number is leaked  by govt website or other means   can the citizen disown the aadhar number like other ids and names surnames via the affidavit route? ie can i file an affidavit that my aadhar number soandso is leaked and not to be trusted for any further transaction put advt in two national papers and be done with it? on a recent trip  i witnessed large scale collection of fingerprints in a temple premises for free food  the reason given was to prevent the same person availing the benefit multiple times for each slot as far as i know  there are no laws in place that makes the fingerprint collection illegalif they were collecting raw fingerprint data  and uidai somehow had access to that  they could match that with the hashes they have  and illegally build a raw fingerprint database linked to peoples identities  which could be misused at scale with horrific consequencesin all the discussions of aadhaar related privacy issues ive seen so far  no one has raised the issue of private players collecting fingerprints from masses and selling it to corrupt officials at uidai  who could use the aadhaar database to build a raw biometrics database that could be used to target citizens at willwould you please raise this issue as well? also  could you petition to stop the ongoing fingerprint collection at the temple? unless im mistaken  it happens everyday  and its quite a popular templevideo of incident https  streamablecom i8l9t we live in a country of where more than half the population do not have permanent address aadhar does not allow us to change addresses easily? so  what shall i do  not move? if my house owner asks me to move shall i quote aadhar as the reason for not shifting?we live in a country where connectivity is at the best 50 or less reliable the service provided by the telecom providers are so bad  that we need to have multiple phone numbers so that we can have a connected when necessity arises so  what do i do? should i put up with bad connectivity and bad customer service because i have recorded this phone against my aadhar? say  my mobile got stolen  what do i do? because it is against my aadhar  i have to go complain  get an fir and make sure the telecom provider either disables and gives me another sim with the same phone number? how do i prevent misuse of my phone now? so  basically while in the past i could have just said forget it it is just a loss of 10k  now i find myself in a position where it is a huge loss  waste of time and effort and making sure i prove that i did not do something wrong? say i got another phone with a different number  how do i change my phone number? it is a myth that address and phone numbers on aadhar can be changed i know of people who are already struggling to do thiswe live in a country where more than half the population has to do manual labor to survive  which means finger prints do not get retained over a period of years that is what we are talking about  not just one year and two years we are talking over a life time over that period of time i get cuts over my finger  i get burns  things get smudged  i have accidents  fingerprints are bound to change so  what shall i do? are we suggesting i cannot live a carefree life because i have enrolled in aadhar? i have to ensure my finger print stays  so another thing i ensure does not happen?what is the means of identifying a person at all? address changes  phones change  fingerprints are nonreliable dna? so  how do we get a fast recognizing dna machine? what is the reliable form of identification that can be automated in the realtime that is required here? none of these have been thought about the environmental factors have not been considered to ensure over a period of 40+ years the same identity can be maintained and proved who has studied fingerprints to ensure nothing changes because of the heat or the dryness of the air  the pollution in the air? yet  this is being linked to all my life savings  insurances  investments and so on everything that i have been doing to ensure a good retirement?so  in the end  the way i see aadhar there will definitely come a time when i cannot prove my identity since all forms of identification used in aadhar is not permanent  i would have linked all my life savings to this form of identification hence all my life work has been wasted and what really has happened is a person who had all the hacking skills was able to just breeze in and use my life savings to live a better life and i who tried to make life better got the worst end of it  because my government told me that all my hard work was worth nothing because i could not prove the 12 digit number that i am quoting belongs to me strange life thank you so much all for doing this amai usually have a problem explaining to my friends why aadhaar is big deal the general mentality ive encountered is that it doesnt matter and privacy is dead in the modern age anyway could you give a plausible negative scenario or two that i could use as an example to explain to them about why we should be concerned most people ive talked to dont care about the leaks at all if i could tell them how exactly it could affect us  that would help raise awareness at whatever level i canthanks again for fighting the system on this and doing what youre doing youre all very helpful to people like me  my question is to   u jackerhack  https  wwwredditcom u jackerhack     u prasanna_s  https  wwwredditcom u prasanna_s     u thejeshgn  https  wwwredditcom u thejeshgn  and   u iam_anandv  https  wwwredditcom u iam_anandv many security researchers like  fs0c131y  https  twittercom fs0c131y  and  troy hunt  https  wwwtroyhuntcom isindiasaadhaarsystemreallyhackproofassessingapubliclyobservablesecurityposture  have found out several vulnerabilities with the madhaar app and the uidai website in spite of all this  neither the website nor the app has been updated why is the organisation so ignorant of these critical issues? im a journalism student interested in aadhaar  full disclosure most of you know who i am  and there are some pretty basic questions i have that ill direct at whoever i think is best equipped to answerto reetika kherawhat is the largest fundamental failure aadhaar has resulted in pds? without going into privacy concerns  has distribution of entitlements improved in any way at all from the preaadhaar era?to anand vwhy is the uidai so inept at handling architectural vulnerabilities and security holes? is it mostly fixable oversight or irreversible negligence? what is  from a tech pov  the largest failure in aadhaar that you think exists?to chinmayiwhat are some things the uidai can do to bake privacy more deeply into how aadhaar works? what  in your opinion  are the major flaws in the aadhaar act and the major flaws in its implementation?to prasannawhat concerns you most about the ongoing aadhaar hearings  especially with the governments arguments and some misconceptions the justices might have?to kiranwhat  in your opinion  is the single biggest security flaw with aadhaar that can be easily fixed but is not being fixed with the uidaito anyonewhat would you personally start with as a foundation in your criticism of aadhaar? i see a lot of really tangential issues being discussed indepth on twitter  so how would you describe the core of your objection to aadhaar as a project?thank you all for doing this  by the way  deleted  thanks for doing this ama  and for all the work you folks are doing on aadhar i have a question  probably best directed to  u prasanna_s but for anyone else who knows the answer  too what exactly is the role that the vidhi center for legal policy is playing in this case? are they governmentfunded or just engaged by the government to deal with this matter?  hey guys just wanted to simply thank for standing against this monstrosity i have seen some of you in interviews   debates on rstv  ndtv  thewire etc its been a pleasure to your thoughts  ideas  deleted  khosla lab has aadhaar bridge as its part  1 vinod khosla is us citizen and come under us laws 2  does not it make clear that us govt can access to all aadhaar data in legal way too ? 1  http  wwwkhoslalabscom aadhaarbridgehtml 2  https  enwikipediaorg wiki vinod_khosla should i bother getting an aadhaar card made or no? how to make make  common people to understand how bad aadhaar is no matter what we say they are ready to do what govt asks and trust it completely  i even got mocked for being overactive for not getting aadhaar hii do we have conclusive details on what is the technology stack of the main aadhaar database? the one which uidai claims to be unhackablemongodb keeps coming up in my searches if its mongodb  its a terrible choice a google search with mongodb is shit will list out the reasons those posts are not by newbies but by experienced engineers who understand databases i say it with confidence as i have burnt my hands because of mongodb  in a top technology company i can share links which have done technical evaluation  if it helps it can be unhackable but its definitely unreliablecan we share technical feedback with uidai? not as individuals but through a platform preferably pseudonymously sharing feedback individually results in name calling by the bkmj team which i would like to avoid if not  are efforts being made in the supreme court to make that a possibility?my worry is  we are spending hundreds of crores of rupees every year to maintain a system which can fail any day is it worth your and my hard earned tax rupees?i despise the aadhaar project but the reality is identity is a problem worth solving and although aadhaar  in its current avatar  is completely useless  we need a solution in general  we need a system for public to give suggestion to the government on the technical aspects i understand  they had hired nandan nilekani for that purpose but he never ran a technology company  he ran digital sweat shops and doesnt understand product development technology we have many people in the technology ecosystem of our country who could contribute and who want to contribute towards this national system but there is no process and we end up with a white elephant system which keeps swallowing up our moniesthis public feedback system needs to be for all government projects can will it be argued in the current aadhaar case or will they has to be a different case pil for that to happen is there a way to reach out to the aadhaar folks if we find flaws   bugs in uidai services  without being fired ? i do not mean tweeting directly like the fsociety guyalso  i read about estonia having a kind of identity system with decentralized storage of data ie each center which needs uses the id system stores its own data what are your thoughts on this? it is not enough to fight aadhar other use of biometrics have to be identified and stopped dont we have right to refuse to use fingerprints for attendence and authentication in offices? for a large infrastructure project say 100 crores  for payment there is only one time authentication and whole money is paid for ration of one week which only costs rs 100 people have to authenticate every time i believe this is humiliation of the poor  and they need to resist it the poor should insist that they will give fingerprint only at the time of creation of the card  question directed to no particular individual on the panel  answer from any one is appreciated  what exactly is the legal requirement of mandatory aadhaarbank account linkage  by 31 3  unless sc comes to the rescue ? to elaborate since i have no faith in aeps  good ole neft and credit cards are good enough for me  can i ask the bank to merely keep my aadhaar no as part of my kyc record and not make it visible to upi?ps thanks all for this ama to anyonewhat is the recourse for an individual in case there is a data breach and his credentials are stolen?if sc rules that aadhar is not mandatory  is there an option for an individual to delink his aadhar?are there any current mechanisms where we can prevent aadhar data sharing or at least regulate who can view it?,2018-01-26 03:01:13
AMA,ama with shakti team,115,96xwjg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/96xwjg/ama_with_shakti_team/,93,hi r india we are a team of students and project staff from iit madras working on shakti processor program we recently tapedout one of our cores on intels 22 ffl technology node and have been successful in powering on the chip and booting linux on it this is a io heavy test chip meant to provide a poc proof of concept  and is not meant for direct consumption  we are excited to answer your queries ask us anythingour new website   shaktiorgin  https  shaktiorgin editthanks for your queries r india it was a pleasure interacting with guys glad to see many tech enthusiasts in herehope to see you in a new ama with our new processor we are signing off thanks again,shaktiteam, hi  im excited to see you taking an ama i heard about your recent tapeout of shakti cores the second public tapeout of riscv in the world congratulationsi have a few questions1  i understand the stages of software design  but hardware is opaque can you give us a overview of the stages of processor design? what stages cost the most time? which ones take the most manpower? 1a  i remember reading that amd zen team spent 2 million man hours over 4 years to design the replacement to excavator since i dont understand much about hardware  how can a small group of entrepreneurs and academics hope to put up the enormous amount of effort needed to build and validate a processor design?2  can you elaborate on your power  performance  area and especially security design goals for your server and desktop class processors? ive read your website but it only mentions features and clockrate of the processors compared to the best intel server and desktop chips of 2018  what is your performance goal? 50 as good? 80?2a  im not asking you to commit to delivering chips on any time frame  but once again  due to my ignorance of hardware  i dont have any idea of how long your chip design efforts will take to meet your design goals for servers and desktop as detailed in 2   how long do you estimate it will take your team to design these chips? 5 years? 10 years?3  im given to understand that the x86 processor family was not designed for security the processor design grew organically over time  so its as full of holes as swiss cheese what systematic hardware and software design changes  if any  are you taking to avoid the security failures of x86  arm and mips family?4  im concerned about the security of riscv chips the chip design world is spending a lot of time and money to formally verify the riscv isa and creating chip designs  but theyre writing drivers and other hardware level software in c or c++  which has had almost 50 years to prove itself insecure i understand that you will need to write code in c for linux related matters  and i dont expect that to change however  have you considered using more secure languages like rust for software that does not have to be in c c++? im pointing this out because whatever language you use for your riscv project is going to be in use 50 years from now i really dont want to be using insecure software in 2068 have you given any thought to this? you have stated on your bitbucketsite that there will be six  or eight  versions of cores  i have seen progress on three of those what is the timeline for the rest of the processors?  another question have you guys considered a copyleft license for your project like cern open hardware license? bsdstyle licenses allow for oneway transfer of intellectual property  whereas copyleft licenses like cohl keep the pool of intellectual property in the public domain using a permissive license like bsd will make it very easy for companies to take your design and make it proprietary  but its not the right license if you want to create a open hardware ecosystem why would a company like samsung take your design and put 250 million dollars of investment to take it to the next level of quality  if the bsd license allows apple to show up  take the results of samsungs hard work and make it proprietary? bsd and linux projects have been around for the same length of time  but while linux has taken over the world  bsd is stagnant companies dont use permissive licenses for software unless they control that stack and its not a core part of their business permissive licences create silos but an open hardware community needs a twoway  copyleft license due to the incentives your license creates  i expect companies and academics to take your work but not give anything back an open hardware community based on your teams work is all but impossible have you considered changing the shakti projects license? hey therefirst off  great job and congratulations what advice would you give to a 2nd year student who loves processors and wants to learn how to build them? where would you have me start with this and what resources  books  software  etc  are available? thanks in advance  amazing work have few queries1 any plans to develop custom unix based os for the processor? 2 any plans to make integrated gpgpu system with industry? what is the process involved in testing these chips? hi  u shaktiteam  welcome to  r india here are some of the questions that were posted on the announcement threadfrom  u nascentmind will you be selling cheap development boards for the community to contribute? i am eager to get my hands on it and would like to contributefrom  u broine hi  thank you for the ama since you mentioned interconnect fabrics  and i am speculating from the pov of high performance computingwhat are the prospects of risc based systems for taking over the next generation of hardware?from  u mynameissomethingtoo congratulations to you guys this is unrelated  but would you like to comment on the spectre and meldown vulnerabilities recently detected in intel chips? can you guys dumb down what exactly had happened and why was everyone freaking out?from  u modiibom questions  because i will surely miss the time slot 1  any timeline of when we will see these processors on a motherboard?2  can we see dmesg output?3  when should we expect indian supercomputer with these chips running? will intel withhold their facilities when they come to know that these chips will be used for supercomputing purpose? can taiwanese fabs be roped in at that time?from  u dylan522p why are you using intel 22nm ffl over a more standard fab for a first tapeout model  such as tsmc 28nm?from  u innovator116 i am emphasizing here as i have said globally  that risvv will need small scale semiconductor fabs model to become ubiquitous when small groups will not just be able to implement risvv based microprocessors but manufacture them as well locally my question is  has the iitm team has reached out to iisc groups working on nanopatterning lithography technologies? a national consortium to design  develop and manufacture ics domestically is need of the hour proprietary hardware is bound to contain backdoors for americans or chinesefrom  u upsky7 do you plan on releasing everything as foss  100 libre   even the gpu?from  u kipboye hey there first off  great job and congratulations what advice would you give to a 2nd year student who loves processors and wants to learn how to build them? where would you have me start with this and what resources  books  software  etc  are available? thanks in advancefrom  u pcein great to see the amazing work you are doing  and thanks for the ama a few questions    can a hobbyist like me try out the shakti processor on an fpga dev board  like the zedboard ?    you mentioned a rust based os for supporting tagged isas in a recent hn post are any details regarding this available?    at the moment  shakti seems like a mostly iitmonly project  any plans on getting the foss community involved in it to a greater extend? hi paul  ssup  so prod to see this day  never thought i would see a batch ate of mine doing an ama on randia  so how long before this will be ready for applications in real world?  right now i think the manufacturing is done in the us  are there any plans for manufacturing in india?  is only gcc and glibc ported as well?  i always thought risc processors were more suited for lowpower embedded applications til you can also put them in hpcs  1 if i had the hardware  what is the fastest way to compile simple c code ? what tools do i need?  2 im bit rusty on systems knowledge  but writing llvm backend for risc must be more difficult than  say x86? because adapting generated ir would be exposed to more instructions?  3 are there any plans to make a gpgpu using riscv ? 4 are you guys hiring? for what positions?  deleted   deleted  great to hear about your progress a couple of questions1 are you going to stick with riscv for the foreseeable future or are you open to getting arm mips licenses and changing out the front end to support a different  and more market oriented  isa?2 any timelines on the i class cores? those would be the most important for any kind of server hpc efforts im guessingthanks for taking the time to do this thank you for doing this i have read into your new amazing webpage and also seen the presentation from neel gala at chennai what is the difference between the aeon and the fclass as well as the difference between the tclass and aegis?  have you run coremark ulpmark on it? hello congratulations on your great success i was aware of your teams work through kunal ghosh here are my questions q1 do you plan to ship a bit of fpga fabric  customizable logic  along with riscv cores? it might help us to build accelerators for some common tasksq2 is it the riscv instruction set as it is or some extra instructions have been included like single cycle mac for developers who might be interested in using it for dsp?q3 iit madras has a very strong data converters team under the very famous shanthi pavan any plans to integrate a adc and or a dac? will be useful for dsp and senser node applications i read it as ama with shaktiman n was like wtf for few seconds  does the license allow other organizations to build on top of your design? arduino like movement?i would love to try a sbc like raspberry pi but with shakti i have seen in the latest workshop from the riscv foundation that there is a company started by neel gala and g s madhusudan called incore semiconductors what is the universitys relationship to this company and who is developing what? thanks in advance and for doing this ama  i have heard that the government is very interested in the project and is sponsoring it to some extent what does this mean for india and the ability to be independent of other countries? is this something that is seen as a big deal or is it just a side benefit? ,2018-08-14 02:01:10

thank you for doing this i hope to visit nepal someday  few years back i read you guys adopted a new constitution how has that worked out? is there any good nepali porn out there? i visited lantang region before the earthquake  it was the most remarkable trips of my lifesome of the villages then didnt have electricity back then in 2015 but i hope nepal electrifies all its villages soon india and nepal has 2 main meta dynamic one is that of the indian state govt  which basically is hated  disliked  not trusted  etc by nepalis state and the people  but at people to people level things are more pleasant this is why the relationship works because the people links are too strong  nepal needs development and personally i am of the view that settings artificial barriers to it is futile development at all costs period like on a war footing no compromises just get it done at all costs deal with the consequences later   even if it means you live less should not matter given they and poor places anyway has short lives  at least when they are developed they will live those short lives better  being predominantly hindu country are there many supertisions or are your people over them? bcoz here mostly hindu hindi belt seems to be superstitious as fuck poverty there could be the reason too  nepalindia relationship was never the same after the murder of the royal family looks like a foreign hand how do chinese tourists get around? is the language barrier significant for them? could you share the stats by country on nepali tourism? is the  royal massacre  https  enwikipediaorg wiki nepalese_royal_massacre  still talked about? any thoughts about the theory that dipendra didnt do it or that india was involved? how is the massacre regarded in terms of its repercussions? has it recovered from the earthquake? ah  i am quite ickypicky about a communist state i know definitions are different in east buta  what is the current status of communist party of nepal ? b  what is general outlook towards economy ? are they considering opening up to fdi ? c  are there any discussions about climate change and its effects ? d  are people aware about debt trap ? e  are nepali aunties uncles as nosey and irritating as indian aunties uncles ?  i was kind of thinking that indianepal relations would get better in case the modi government falls next year but was just reading some thread on  r nepal and looks like you guys hate congress even more because they are accused of supporting the nepali maoists is there any redemption you see in ties? lord buddha was born in india and garhwal was a part of nepal before being a part of indiahow many times you guy watch gharwali bahar waali in a month ?this is what i used to say to my nepali roommate in college  great job dude to show up and even deal with the entitled aholes  too#x200b indians  as someone said  are proudest of the least to be proud of  nepal should definitely lead the way as it always has done kathmandu was global long before india even knew what flower power was the current reality is that china has made the great leap forward and has 10 000 per capita income  an aging population and a huge savings hoardand anyone who partners with them will definitely benefit for all the talk  china has always been a civilization content with itself  and not expansionist #x200b my dream is that nepal shows the way and helps be the bridge between india and china and thus creates a global powerhouse with 1 2 the worlds population  huge shared landmass and sweet synergy in manufacturing and services coupled we literally wouldnt even need the west india provides employment opportunities to many nepalis they are eligible even for the highest government services in india  and are freely eligible for all sorts of private employment do you think your government is ignoring vital indian interests in moving so close to china despite this?what if india revokes this special treatment to nepali citizens suddenly? it has helped people of your country so much in the past its almost like indians going to us for a better life  but while us needs workforce in those fields  stem   in case of india its just a goodwill gesturebasically  whats an ordinary nepalis opinion  would you like a friendly india with special all weather friendship  or a more transactional whats in it for me kind of diplomacy where you lean towards anybody whos giving you a better deal in that moment? also consider the cultural similarities between you and india  vs the other side of himalayas  and tibet  ,2018-09-12 04:33:48

AMA,hey r india  i am a intraday trader who made 29l+ in fy 201718 on a capital of 10l would love to dispense some misconceptions about intraday trading ama,150,8hehlq,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8hehlq/hey_rindia_i_am_a_intraday_trader_who_made_29l_in/,204,proof of profits  sharekhan  zerodha pnl reportshttps  imgurcom a eemzn3gmy twitter https  twittercom bhatiamanups this is a throwaway,intraday_trader, bhai  say something basic about where to start all the full time traders i have seen till date feels like rely on luck more than half the times their calls fail what strategies do you use as an intraday trader? what patterns charts tools do you people use? i relatively have learnt about how stoploss becomes an important factor that 1 big profitable trade can beat 10 small triggered stoplossesbut i have difficulty in selecting stocks for derivatives intraday and also predicting the patternedit have burnt around 50k in options last year in 2 months thats quite an outstanding performance imo congrats on that1 do you ever indulge in derivative trading if yes  what would you prefer stock derivatives  or index derivatives ? 2 have you ever hedged your positions through options ? like using a protective put strategy  ?3 how much do you rely on quantitative analysis  and how much on intuition ? have you ever performed regression testing or used quantitative models like ewma ?4 what role do you think fundamentals  ie reported balance sheet figures  lay on intraday  trading  and have you ever bet on high volatility events such as budget day or announcing of quarterly results ?5 what parameters do you set while exiting a transaction  eg exit after a max of 5#37  profit or 5#37  loss  ?6  which would you place an intraday bet on ? a small cap stock  midcap stock or a bluechip one ? i would like you to imagine a national coinflipping contest lets assume we get 225 million americans up tomorrow morning and we ask them all to wager a dollar they go out in the morning at sunrise  and they all call the flip of a coin if they call correctly  they win a dollar from those who called wrong each day the losers drop out  and on the subsequent day the stakes build as all previous winnings are put on the line after ten flips on ten mornings  there will be approximately 220 000 people in the united states who have correctly called ten flips in a row they each will have won a little over 1 000now this group will probably start getting a little puffed up about this  human nature being what it is they may try to be modest  but at cocktail parties they will occasionally admit to attractive members of the opposite sex what their technique is  and what marvelous insights they bring to the field of flippingassuming that the winners are getting the appropriate rewards from the losers  in another ten days we will have 215 people who have successfully called their coin flips 20 times in a row and who  by this exercise  each have turned one dollar into a little over 1 million 225 million would have been lost  225 million would have been wonby then  this group will really lose their heads they will probably write books on how i turned a dollar into a million in twenty days working thirty seconds a morning worse yet  theyll probably start jetting around the country attending seminars on efficient coinflipping and tackling skeptical professors with  if it cant be done  why are there 215 of us?by then some business school professor will probably be rude enough to bring up the fact that if 225 million orangutans had engaged in a similar exercise  the results would be much the same  215 egotistical orangutans with 20 straight winning flips what is your daily weekly profit target ?how many trades do you do in a day ?what exactly do u use in technical tool for entry  exits ?   like macd stoch oscill  or other?  what is your daily loss limit ?do you trade from home ?how much tax you pay for intra day profits ?you said volatility is important  what technical indicator you use for it ?do you track open positions in fo markets for profit booking and longs unwinding  scenarios ?which day of the week has is most volatile for equities ? do you use automated trading based on python ? for how long you have been trading ? my dad told me this is like gambling how accurate is that?if you hit the jackpot or you loose everything  deleted  what do you use to backtest your strategies and execute your strategies?

are these covered under the proposed bill  or arethese to be treated separately?2 clause 21b is psedonymised data a permissible alternative for businesses toclaim that they have suitably anonymised the data?3 does the 21h definition of _communication_ encompass keystrokes  screenshotsand other electronic signals that may enable creation of pii? will backchannelattacks to steal encryption keys be construed unlawful under the provision of thisbill?4 the gdpr definition of personal data  includes  https  eceuropaeu info law lawtopic dataprotection reform whatpersonaldata_en        different pieces of information  which collected together can lead to the        identification of a particular person  also constitute personal data           does the definition in 21u personal data incorporate this aspect?## scope1 how does the bill treat personal data of minors under 13? this is a lucrativeuser base for certain industries  and we have seen quite a few data breaches involving childrens data2 how will the current lawful intercept regime be impacted by such a bill? willthis lead towards the creation of special  fisalike courts  with unfettered powers?3 suppose civic volunteers create a database in the form of a spreadsheet to help distressed individuals during a natural calamity which they then forget to dispose offwill the proposed privacy commission act suo motu  to ensure safe disposal of such zombie data? 4 the current interpretation of  public order  https  cisindiaorg internetgovernance blog freespeechandpublicorder1 requires relevance  and mandates proportionate action  for greater good however  we see the phrase public order has become  increasingly popular  https  imgurcom a 6ta3xt9  in recent case records do youforesee abuse of this provision in near future?5 while _ex post facto_ laws are notoriously difficult  article 20 does not particularlyforbid such a law  sujjan singh v state of punjab  do you see a parallel in businesseswhich continue to profit from data collected at an earlier era and the corruption case?## business impact1 do you see the need for a transition period to allow businesses to incorporatethe recommendations  and streamlining the proposed privacy commissions processes?2 per the provision of 513 an airbnb host can install cctv cameras which becomea nightmare for a guest at a later time how do you propose the bill deal with suchcases?3 suppose the medical history of a comatose patient  suffering from a rare disease is of interest to researchers is it then the nextofkins decision whether or notto share the data?

it may be difficult for consumers such as i to get access to such a sophisticated software to stop them8 can we create an anonymous crowd sourced privacy app  acpa  to show us which developers sell our data and to what extent?9 mumbai currently has cctv cameras with facial recognition present everywhere how are they protecting my data under the archaic it act? what are they doing with my data? who has access to the footage and how can i secure it?10 does justice srikrishnas new data protection bill have a clause for whistle blowers or ethical hackers such as edward snowden or will someone who does something similar be left for the dogs? heya you guys are doing something really really important  please keep doing the good work and thank youmy question is most people dont take privacy seriously  they just hand over any document they are asked for without even a single thought and this becomes even more worrisome in case of aadhar i personally get in a agrument on weekly basis with people around me just for thishow does one explain to them that this is dangerous and they shouldnt share anything with anyone just cause someone asks for it and especially not their aadhar number  what is the most logical and simplest agrument against not sharing your information according to youand again thank you  really we the citizens are indebted to your fight and cause hey gautam sir following you since your gold record days at bangalore big fan of yours  wish to know that how advisable is it to lock biometric details on the aadhar website?  also what is the case where nongovernment agencies ask for aadhar details? like banks or when couriers ask it for verification? not giving them amounts to nonaccessation of services so whats the alternative? any provision for me to delete my aadhar details from the system or is it like lifetime liability which the govt has handed us? why is there no option on the uidai website to change the mobile number details? why is googlecom tracking me on every other website? like reddit  facebook? how to shoo it away  although blocking it using the privacy badger makes sites nonfunctional at times what is your advice you would like to give to your 20 year selves? what precautions do you take regd online mass surveillance which happens how to fight it?edit for apar  how have you automated deletion of your tweets after a month and why? what are your views on data localisation  both with respect to the indian privacy code  as well as the justice srikrishna committee report?  thanks for ama  here are my questions1 your bill defines personal data only to the extension of personal identification but what about the situations when a sample size is taken and it leads to identification but not the personal identification example google adds some are based on your data  shopping  browsing  and some are based on demographics  what indian people like  obsession with foreign brands  how we will be address that? 2 as we already know  most of developing democracies have data protection law and authorities  though needs to be strengthen  but that dont stop corporations from misusing it then how we will we able to stop them considering almost all the tech based are foreign funded and have big pockets 3 as in this internet age  if you are consuming something for free  then you yourself are the product  considering this  dont you think convenience will always overshadow privacy barring few enlighten and rich souls?  4 as all this eulas  tc are lengthy legal jargon and people just accepts them  where the real privacy stays and how explicit consent is derived in these situations as this is almost like you have to accept it otherwise there is no alternative  even the law like eus gdpr is not able to simplify it 5 considering that the world is on the brink of fourth industrial revolution and it will be fuelled by data  can we expect that in the upcoming time certain portion of personal data will defacto remain in public domain  name  dob  banks account number  address etc  just like older days though now only certain clicks away 6 what about sting operations and mobile devices sending data for analytical purposes? 7 why cant ne aadhar number can be seen as indian replacement for social security number to avail basic services like phone number  bank accounts etc?8 what tools do you guys use for privacy protection? which phone  phone os  laptop  laptop os  internet browser and addons? 9 why not constitutional status for privacy commission in your bill  considering it is going to be new norm in upcoming time just like election and election commission?10 no specific clause for right to be forgotten in you bill which hits to the core of internet as they say you cant really delete once something is on internet? not a relevant comment on an ama  but can someone do a tldr or explain in layman terms what the judgement is about? what is the stand of iff regarding cryptocurrency usage in india?  what are your thoughts on aadhar? tysm for doing this amamany queries regarding current scenario  here are just a fewis the idea of finding the source of fake news feasible? it is like cut one head and 2 more shall take its place   how many will the govt book too much too bring under control  shouldnt there be some other way?has the govt or civil soc made any plans on how to curb this menace in the coming election year? i bet whatsapp will be massively used for propagation and hoaxesthe current idea of making internet giants place a server in india to curb fake news ok no problem what if govt uses this to curb dissenting  criticising voices what are the checks and balances in that case?why cant whatsapp have option of marking a particular msg as spam more the number of reports it gets on a particular msg  it can analyse and block its forwarding?why cant user be asked for permission before he is added to any group?#x200b  your thoughts on the ib ministry team that monitors news channel for news on pm? where do i get this saveourprivacy sticker from? are vpns legal in india and if yes  which vpn would you recommend for indian users? what would be a short and definitive response to the rhetoric i have nothing to hide why should i care about privacy?  given the advent of data protection laws such as gdpr in the western world how likely is it that a law with similar scope and emphasis on enduser data will be implemented in india?do you think the general public in india has little to no knowledge of the consequences of sharing their private data?what is stopping indian companies right now from using our data without consent? which platform would you recommend if i am demanding sending nudes to my gf?   snapchat facebook texting whatsapp?  what is with sc reserved judgement on aadhaar? is there any date given by when it will be released? i have been educating myself on privacy and how its important for me and no one is entitled to gain access to my personal information without my concent i opted for these changes and need recommendation for what else can i do to be more secure with my information on internet i switched to firefox    google chrome is a browser make for tracking individuals on the internet and when i founded it out  i immediatly switched to  firefox firefox provides tracker protection  i keep it to always on and i combined it with a ad blocker  ublock origin  i switched default my search engine to duckduckgo  i have been using duckduckgo for a while now and it works like a charm  in the aspect of searches  i never felt the need to go back to google seach i also use  duckduckgo extention  https  addonsmozillaorg enus firefox addon duckduckgoforfirefox   i am also using a opensource password manager called  keepass 2  https  keepassinfo  edit  here is another thing i wanted to aski really want to use a vpn but i am unable to afford any so  is there some way that i can get a vpn for free i know about  openvpn  https  openvpnnet   but i think its complicated and will take far more time to master  still is there someone willing to teach me how to use openvpn? i dont have any issues learning   hiyour team is doing a yeoman serviceyou deserve the support of every indianr antiaadhar activists are solidly behind youquestions1 before his term ends  can the current cji subvert the landmark privacy judgement and still push aadhaar onto the indian citizen?2 govt of karnataka has enacted aadhaar act in march 2018 in karnataka  all govt departments are demanding aadhaar by default  for property inheritance  for registration of sale deeds  issue of income certificate and much more how can a citizen fight this?3 filing of writ petition  civil  is the only way to get courts to drill sense into overenthusiastic babus who wrongly enforce aadhaar for everything under the sun can internet freedom foundation provide a platform wherein citizens can file class action suits  claim punitive damages?thank you hi folks thanks for fighting the good fight and sorry about the late questionsq 1  whats your take on the various surveillance systems created by individual states?like 1  this in punjab  https  wwwhuffingtonpostin 2018 08 15 facialrecognitionaiisshakingupcriminalsinpunjabbutshouldyouworrytoo_a_23502796 2  the aadhar connected surveillance system in andhra pradesh https  huffingtonpostin 2018 07 23 howandhrapradeshbuiltindiasfirstpolicestateusingaadhaarandacensus_a_23487838 these two came to mind as of now  but im sure theres more is there anything that citizens can do against the state that seems hell bent on making its life easier at the expense of its citizens?q 2  whats your take on companies that sell tech that enable a surveillance state?  im mostly interested in the indian context these include amazons rekognition to the desi companies like staqu  first link in this comment  given that western deployments of this sort of tech appears to disproportionately affect marginalised communities  its almost certain that these tech deployments will target the already heavily oppressed communities in indiawhat do you think about the ethics of selling such tech in india where they will be deployed without any sort of accountability or oversight or consultation with stakeholders  like every other surveillance system  i suppose ? is there any check that can be applied to these companies or state central governments  especially given that us citizens might not even know the full extent of the indian surveillance state unless we get a major whistleblower? how do we balance the need for a surveillance state in order to ensure our security from external threats with the need to protect us citizens from potentially malicious actors within the stateonce again  thanks for all your efforts and i apologise for the rambling nature of the questions   many thanks for the amaa data protection bill is but a subset of a comprehensive privacy bill yet  even for this subset  i have not seen any movement in the ministry or cabinet and ultimately parliament  other than the rather unsatisfactory srikrishna committee report and draft bill being submitted to the it ministerso  basically my question is while your privacy code is a great effort  when and how will the rubber meet the road in parliament? also in this context  please share your opinion on shashi tharoors bill thanks apple vs google on data collection  privacy  incl selling of personal data ,2018-08-24 02:22:37

AMA,ama  i orchestrated a protest against an impossible force corrupt businessmen media  politicians  police  for justice in india and won it changed the system in an entire state this post is meant to be a guide for whistleblowers on how to run a successful campaign in india as an ordinary person,557,8gziej,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8gziej/ama_i_orchestrated_a_protest_against_an/,79,last year  i had made a  post on this very subreddit  https  npredditcom r india comments 5mybd4 serious_a_student_committed_suicide_after_mental   asking your help to fight against injustice i was a desperate person at that time and didnt think that there is any chance that it will be successful after writing that post  i unknowingly became the mastermind behind a protest against corrupt college administrators  corrupt police officers and the media which would refuse to listen to us because they were getting money from these corrupt peoplethis incident involves the torture and the death of a student caused by the college management  bribing the police and media to keep quiet  several months of protests which bloomed into a statewideunrest forcing the politicians to change sides  arrest  imprisonment of the absconding chairman of a college  vice principal  owners etc and finally the reform of the education system of an entire state and  i was the one who orchestrated the protest which resulted in all of this i spent every conscious hour of two months of my life working behind this campaigni dont want to repeat the entire incident  so you can read about the incident in detail in its well written  wikipedia page  https  enwikipediaorg wiki nehru_college_of_engineering_and_research_centre  make sure to read about the student death controversy and then the police report which is below under different subsection also you can go through my old posts in this subreddit like  this post  https  npredditcom r india comments 5mybd4 serious_a_student_committed_suicide_after_mental   and  this photo  https  npredditcom r pics comments 5niiw4 this_is_not_saudi_arabia_they_are_not_muslims  i am making this askmeanything so that my experience can help people who think i am just an ordinary person  i cant change the system  i cant protest against injustice or they are rich and corrupt  so there is no way to bring them to justice  so i should better move on with my life and do nothing or all the problems is due to the current system government and i cant do anything about iti was a no one in this incident i didnt know the victim i was not even a student of that college at that time i was an exstudent i had no benefit in doing any of this also  i did all of it anonymously no one except about 5 friends know that i was working behind the scenes also  my major contribution was in directing the protest  contacting the right people  managing the information and running the campaign i did majority of it by just sitting in a room with a laptop there were hundreds of other brave people who staged the protest and did the things which i wanted to be donei didnt start out thinking i will coordinate this protest or spend so much time on it this all started out when i started a facebook page asking justice for the victim i regularly posted new content and people started contacting me with new information or asking me what they should do within few days  i was having so much contact with so many people from various backgrounds like students  teachers  reporters  lawyers  exstudents  parents etc that i unknowingly became the one who was running the entire campaign both online and offlineso many people selflessly helped in finding information some law students of other colleges volunteered to write legal notices or other such stuff some people traveled great distances to find certain information some people had contacts with politicians and was able to mobilize partymen some brought in media some were reporters who were directly taking content from me and posting it some were helping in the creation of the content and  i had to ensure that the content i was providing is trueafter about a month of work  it started showing signs of success we started to get the attention of mainstream media who started posting the full details without censoring anything then  few weeks later  this became the headline news of all the newspapers in the state it became the talk of the town i overheard so many people discussing about this incident while travelling in trains or busesthen  student protests broke out at many private colleges across the state demanding student unions and fighting against injustices few colleges even lost their affiliation and closed down due to this incident and  students of one such engineering college was transferred to better colleges my friends and relatives at several other colleges said that the situation has improved after this incident,HelpSaveStudents, someone should make this into a movie seriously it would give hope to a lot of people  and plus it probably wouldnt be too expensive to make  how did you deal with all the stress from it?  what changes do you want to see at the top level management or through the board of trustees of any given college? profs and management in indian colleges treat students like dogsthen times of india publishes an article why no microsoft or apple from india? well done op india sorely needs more people like you a word of caution to anyone who draws inspiration from this keep your goals real and also keep in mind that the threats to your life are very realthere are plenty of good people in india  plenty willing to stand for what is right the trouble is that many among them become mute spectators to the tragedies and injustices in india what you did  op  deserves tremendous praise and you deserve itmark my words  though  this is a very dangerous thing to do in a country like india you may be anonymous now but dont count on this always being the case tread cautiously guys like you give me hope about the country  a breather from the general r india  lets emigrate crowd respect for you man  great job man  thats all i can say i hope this empowers more people to speak up against wrong doings around them  are you still continuing? much respect  how about 1 someone in the community here makes a fb page to out corruption anonymously2 we sticky the post on reddit3 get behind crowdsourcing evidence against corruption  aka the evidence is sent annonymously either through fb messages or through redddit  the master above can provide all the expertise needed 23 people manage the page jointly and completely annonymously there is life risk in this for sure didnt know #justiceforjishnu had such a mastermind well done op  you are a true inspirationproud of you aliyaaa  were you afraid while doing this? oh wow  i have a lot of friends who passed out from this shitty college and ive only heard bad things about their management nowhere have i seen such a unified hatred amongst ex students towards their own college such as this that speaks volumes as to how bad the situation really is  im so glad that you orchestrated this while remaining anon and did not sacrifice your safety for the greater good more power to people like you  how did you make sure your identity wasnt compromised?  i cant upvote you enough great job and kudos to you after reading the wiki page i felt enraged at how degrading the management can be you taught them a good lesson proud of you were you or your family threatened at any point? what can we do to protect ourself from all that threats?i respect what you have done for the society i hope you will give your voice to forthcoming issues and continue activism holy shit  that wikipedia page is dank this is very cool dude well done i am very proud of you this gives me hope  this needs to be more visible within india every parent of a teenager needs to know that such evil colleges exist and they should  be very mindful of where they are getting their children admitted the more i think about it the more it reminds me of my own college days and ragging controversies that we got involved in as freshers i feel that we need a directory of all schools and their faculty  staff and facilities with ranking we need to crowd source it to get a lot of data in anyone know of such a website? isdborg  indian schools database  anyone?well done op youre a hero i want to see more posts like this everyday  good work dude i read the wiki page  your college seems to have every kind of repressive idea executed with north korean efficiency so have the laws against

      2  with whatever experience you have  do you think the judiciary is totally fair impartial when dealing with false cases of dowry  rapes etc?  deleted  this was a pretty hard letdown of an ama op had the chance to show mras are serious about mens rights but ended up with the same ol misogynistic  antifeminist views weve seen time and time againhighlightsand what relief does a woman who is in distress after being raped within marriage get by jailing the husband? how do you educate people misandry is a thing? just educate them that womens rights are not continuously being trampled upon when comparing mens and womens rights  do you believe that one deserves more attention than the other? do you consider issues like mental health problems like depression  anxiety among males  and the pressure to have a masculine   macho image etc a priority  and what is your take on tackling them ? what are your views on the lack of laws against martial rape? if you are against criminalization of martial rape  could you please tell me why? do you have numbers on men being falsely accused? if not  do you plan on conducting a study to gather these numbers?mens rights activism has attracted some of the vilest misogynists of the world to its cause  what are your views on these men?what steps has your organization taken in changing the law that basically declares that men cannot be raped? also about raya sarkars list of sexual predators  are you for or against it? in a country where womens rights are continuously trampled upon and men are continuously accused of promoting a patriarchal society  how do you convince people that misandry is a thing too? what do you think of the meninism ?https  enwikipediaorg wiki meninism what are your views on martial rape? ive come across a lot mra keyboard warriors  who seemed reasonable people fighting for a good cause  only to find out that theyre just plain redpill seduction community influenced misogynists how often does this happen with you? i assume it must be infuriating to have misogynists trying to hijack your cause and using it as a shield i would like to refer to you a comment in a  thread made a while back  https  wwwredditcom r india comments 7a1zx0 men_of_randia_were_you_ever_assaulted dp6ijdo now if you notice in a comment further he says the main issue was that the guys have difficulty in even admitting that  it happened  https  wwwredditcom r india comments 7a1zx0 men_of_randia_were_you_ever_assaulted dp6lr8q  probably because of the shameso i want to know what you guys think is the best ways to change this type of mentality among men themselves? and how underreported is sexual violence against men?  misandry is as bad as misogyny  tc apply  https  wwwredditcom r india comments 7dcctp lets_slay_misandry_hi_guys_i_am_amit_deshpande_a dpwso4n ?stja2o9b5zsh24869092  from your website i came to know of a suicide helpline for men that your organisation runs can you tell us more about it? hi amit ji  so what do you think is going wrong the system or the society? also  should all men and families be worried? what can education ministry do to reduce dropouts among boys i cant believe randia gave a platform to this guy hes an incel in real life just read the stuff he writes  i have seen men on whom false cases of dowry harrasment and domestic violence is slapped  although they havent taken any dowry in order to harrasment them because this usually comes with a demand for alimony or maintenance i also see them being blackmailed coldmindedly by this they have a tendency settle the cases with hefty amounts of alimony because this affects their daily schedule of work and they find it difficult to continue to work they say that if they continue litigation to prove their point  they will lose out on precious years of their liveswhat suggestions or advice would you give to such men? how should they cope up with the stress involved? moreover what should be done so that justice prevails and one doesnt support and encourage false case accusers by settling the disputes outside courts as this gives a wrong picture to the society and govt?

AMA,i recently emmigrated from india ama,17,9dkov2,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9dkov2/i_recently_emmigrated_from_india_ama/,46,i spent a majority of my childhood outside india in the middle east i returned to india roughly 20 years ago i had fully settled in to india i didnt quite miss anything from the middle east barring the food and stable electricity p i had a choice to make about 10 years ago  to move out of india and i chose not to mostly because my friend circle  my gf  and most of my family was in india at the time i found a job in a great company that kickstarted my career fairly well due in part to my own existential crisis  due in part to a change in outlook around 6 years ago post mba  and due in part to everything that has been happening in the country for the last few years  i gradually started finding living in the country to be unbearable this is not an antibjp post by any means ive never been political and i do not see myself ever being i do have ideologies which at the very core is live and let liveor to be bluntunfortunately and im sure a lot of you agree  the indian society simply isnt going to let you do that its not that i was living a loud flamboyant life its that even the simple life i tried to live was being threatened in several ways this group  r india though often negative in tone has also helped open my eyes to a lot of things this discourse is important  if for nothing else  as an outlet for folks who are frustrated for folks to empathize and sympathizeat this point  we begin a change in tonei saw my friends  colleagues and classmates gradually all leave the country some of them left around 810 years ago none of them show a genuine interest in returning but this didnt really bother me i still had a great friends circle and ive always been exceptionally great and keeping in touch with my friends and meeting them every chance i get nothing was changing my mind that i needed to move out but one day  something just snapped i spoke to a friend of mine over dinner she was a classmate from college she had been working with a firm in australia see the thing is  she and i never spoke in college but we just knew each other i saw on fb that she was in town  we got chatting and decided to meet up she was asking why i dont look for opportunities abroad i said i never felt that things are necessarily that much better there she said she could potentially find me a job i found out that she and i were in similar industries she was earning postconversion  around 60l more than me i told her that really doesnt matter given living costs she told me she saves roughly 20 lpa and believe me  shes not someone who tries to save this was a time when i was commuting about 90 minutes one way to work 8km she travels 20 minutes to work and can afford to stay away from the central expensive parts of the city due to great public transport she lives a healthy and fun life has coworkers who know to stick to their boundaries has no one bother her about what she wears  who shes with  what she eats etc i couldnt find a single objective measure  to counter her with i made it my lifes mission to find out for myself whether this was all truly the case so i started looking out thankfully  my wife was offered a perfectly timed transfer to a western country for 2 years and that came with a visa for me as well and so i took the leap found myself a job before i landed here its been a few months now and ive finally seen what this other side is like today this is an abrupt end to this post but thats because theres too much to write if i explained everything elseso feel free now to ask me anything you want about my thoughts experiences,fbai, enjoy your lifehope you job and country suits you well  what a fascinating and humane post curious indian question is your then gf your now wife? also  at what age did you and your family return to india? i am lucky that i make around 45 lpa in india and save around  35 lakh i dont have office and have no office timings i am living in a village  my hometown so overall a healthy life i can get my health checked today without any waiting time but one harsh truth i realized lately is that we are all going to die any way and none of these lpa comparison  instagram  facebook matters i honestly wish i was born like 30 years before  where people lived peacefully and money doesnt matter  or 30 years later  where previous generation fucked up the environment for good and people will be eating tablets for their daily survival  where money doesnt matter  omg  did i go too far ?  p     how old were you when you emigrated? what field do you work in? was finding a job easy? youre so lucky that you and your wife are on the same page when it comes to moving abroad  but it does come with its fair share of struggles i understand a lot of your relatives and friends might be looking at you as if you are living a very cosy life but there must be a whole bunch of struggles that you both might be having thereother than leaving your aging parents back home and subsequent mental trauma  what might be the struggles that youre facing there? wow youre such a rare butterfly nobody ever emigrated from india before  have you ever thought about the privileges you have that have allowed you to make this choice so easily?,2018-09-07 06:39:00
