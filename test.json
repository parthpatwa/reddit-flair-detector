{"azoh6g": {"id": "azoh6g", "post": "suddenly  one nation  one policy sentiment is overtaking other models interview with yv reddy  ias  former rbi governor and 14th finance commission chairmanyou have said in your book that there is a feeling in some quarters that cooperative federalism is being replaced with coercive federalism what is the basis for this comment?some developments have taken place after the 14th finance commissions  fc  recommendations cesses and surcharge have increased significantly  even after gst the states felt that they were being shortchanged by the way the centrally sponsored schemes  css  were restructured  increasing the share that the state government has to put in and then the way the gst is being administered the general debate earlier was about the bihar model competing with the gujarat model and different states models of development competing with each othernow  suddenly the one nation  one policy sentiment is overtaking the other models and the planning commission  which was a forum for states  is also not there nowdue to this institutional vacuum  ministries are directly dealing with css so  the spirit of discussion and dialogue is being replaced by diktats by various ministries some say that there is no dialogue  which is untypical of cooperative federalismyouve said that states are now forced to share more from their own resources in css after your own 14th fc recommendations  the impression was that the centre was devolving more to the states as it went up from 32 to 42as my coauthor gr reddy will explain  the comparison is not between 32 and 42  what was 39 became 42  because of the way the computations differed this increase was more than offset by the other actions on cesses and surcharges and css so there has been virtually no advantage for the statesgr reddy the 14th fc considered the entire revenue account unlike the previous fcs  it considered even the plan revenue account as a result  some of the plan transfers were subsumed under tax devolutionthe difference between 14th fc and others is that the former did away with sector specific grants that amount to 45 of the total devolution if you take these two together  the actual devolution would have been 39 earlier and that became 42 even this 3 increase is not very visible because it has been more than neutralised by the centre the reality is that it has increased the matching contribution of the states in css and done away with 6000 model schools started in 2011  half way through  in 201516  it took a decision to terminate the entire scheme of model schoolsthe entire burden of running schools and meeting expenditure  both capital and operational expenditure  has now fallen on the statesthey then restructured 66 css into 22 umbrella schemes so there is no change in the number of css schemes all components have remained the samewhy didnt states raise the issue?we have done so before the 15th fc and communicated to the centre that what they had done was not correctimmediately after the 14th fc recommendations were accepted  the hon prime minister wrote to us saying now that the states are flush with funds  we wrote back saying there is absolutely no increase in the flow of funds to the states  but only a change in the composition of transfers in favour of untied transfers now what has happened is there has been a qualitative change in the transfers to states  we are getting more money through untied transfersthe total transfers as a percentage of gross revenues to the states from the centre has remained at the same level  49arent untied transfers desirable? it frees states to use funds for whatever purpose they deem fitwhatever additional money to have come through untied transfers is now tied up towards meeting the additional commitmentin the revised pattern of css  you have to put in more moneyyou have made a commitment  you cant uncommit but they have changed the pattern whatever untied funds you have got  you put in those schemesfor example  in 2014  telanganas contribution to the css was around 2 000 crore in 201516  because of the change in funding patterns  it has gone up to 3 500 crore so there is additional commitment on the part of the statesthere is further commitment for states  because of termination of some css  the model schools scheme is an example another is brgf  backward regions grant fund  for telangana state  9 of the then 10 districts were under the brgf they substantially reduced allocations under women and child welfare alsothere is a view that there are just too many css  money is not efficiently usedthe other concern with css is that the money is too thinly spread across schemes for example  if you take education or health  states are spending close to 80 the centre is supplementing the states up to only 20  which does not make much difference that too comes with conditionalities  submission of uses  visits of central teams  delays in release of funds as a result of these procedures  we are unable to fully utilise the centres allocations i dont think any state has used the funds from centre entirelyso the solution is to offer funds and allow states a free hand?the commission under dr reddy recommended the same  that the number of css should be restricted to some nationally identified prioritiesdr yv reddy basic issue is that finance commission is one mechanism which essentially is meant for sharing of taxes and that is based on a formula 8090 of transfers to states has always been on tax devolution in tax devolution  there are no conditions  how much weight you give for population  which census population and other consideration namely as fiscal capacity the only question there is what weight you give if you give weight equally for efficiency and equity  they cancel out  in some senseyou mentioned institutional vacuum do you think niti aayog has not been able to step up to the plate?there were some deficiencies in the way the planning commission functioned there was an impression given to the states that they had to go to the commission as a supplicant but not for discussion that was its weakness which had to be corrected in the correction process  that bad habit was got rid of but there was no new system there is no forum now each ministry has become an authority unto itself and is able to dictate terms to the statesis it deliberate that the aayog does not have power or did it evolve thus?that is a question mark whether it was by design or by default  the result is that the individual ministries are indicating to the states  which means there is no coherent and comprehensive view of the states in the processthere is a view that some of the terms of reference of the 15th fc may not stand the test of constitutional validity whats your view?there are 34 issues it is true that it generated unprecedented reaction never before for an fc have a number of cms got together and protested also  some scholars questioned the constitutional validity of some terms of reference  for example  whether there is need for revenue deficitthe constitution provides for it and each fc needs to decide on this third  the 15th fc has been asked to review the 14th fc it is a continuing process above all  the commission has been asked to make recommendations keeping in view some performance indicators and that states should conform to certain policy parameters  which reflected the existing policy of the centrethe way the fc is structured  it is not supposed to be an instrument of the central governments priorities of the day so it has been questioned on several groundsmost of the considerations mentioned in the tor are not necessarily binding on the fc the commission can choose to or choose not to take these into account but it needs courage and vision for the commission to do so  we are hoping that will be therewhats your view on the controversy over the base date of population census in the 15th fc?the whole question is whether it is a correct thing or not it is difficult to defend outdated population as the basis because the fc is supposed to take into account the needs of the state for the period how can 1971 population determine the needs of the state in 2021? it was undertaken on the grounds that states should not be penalised but what about states that have taken action on family planning after 1971? they dont get anything it should be a continuing incentive  right?this time  they prescribed 2011 population that is also not valid the fc recommendations are from 2020 so you should have estimated population of the states for the period 20202025 ideally  there should be no stipulation of a date for population and should be left to the fc but if at all  one should have the population relevant for the periodisnt gst a good example of cooperative fiscal federalism?it is an extraordinary institution and is commendable it did not come into existence overnight it started as an informal committee in the finance ministry and has evolved in the implementation  there has been dissatisfaction expressed the fact that the centre has a veto increases its influence but that is part of the game concerns may be there in the way it is working but as an institutional set up  it is extraordinarily good it is a good example of collaboration and cooperation in an institution between the union and the statescan this be replicated in other areas?exactly this is on the revenue side on the expenditure side  fiscal transfers outside the fc  it can be brought under some interstate council that was the recommendation of the 14th fcthe gst council may not be replicated but is a good approach to build on on the expenditure side  it is a different type of collaboration  compared to the revenue sideis that a recommendation that the 15th fc can give?yes the transfers to the states from the centre can take fc and nonfc routes the 14th fc gave recommendations on how to structure the nonfc transfers its only in the ambit of advicethere are three approaches virtually abolish the commission by making a constitutional amendment and say this will be the percentage  the second is to have a continuous fc  a gst council type of mechanism but the fc gets subsumed in this  the third is to have the fc and a design of new institutional arrangements which will be more technical  more political and more consensusbased  as recommended by the 14th fcall this is provoked partly because of the gst council which has been positive and partly because of the institutional vacuum  both these are pushing us to find new institutional mechanismspleasantly surprised at the functioning of the gst council it comprises people with varying vote bank compulsionsthe consensus has been the result of number of years of effort consultative process has been going on for the last 1015 years states also are convinced that it is a winwin situation  for the sake of tax harmonisation across the country  they felt it was better and there was also the feeling that gst is a better form of tax  leading to better compliance it builds up a value chain initially  there was some apprehension on part of manufacturing states that they may lose out this being a destination tax so we have put in place a 2 year statutory mechanism that they will be compensated for a period of 5 years the states have yielded lot more space than the centre for states  vat constituted about 60 of their old tax revenue they have conceded 50 of their fiscal space to the centre  whereas the space conceded by the centre is only 30 they still get customs duty  income tax etc in the working  there is still a trust deficit because the voting pattern is fully loaded in favour of the centre  which has almost a veto powerthen  the way the gst is administered is also raising apprehensions in the minds of the people that they are not being treated fairly by the centre like delays in apportionment of igst  delays in payment of compensation cess  collecting more compensation cess than required best thing to do is to reduce compensation cess correspondingly that they are not doing so there is surplus compensation cess lying with the centre to be distributed after 5 years it is for the centre to set the record straight and remove this trust deficiton the special category status for andhra pradesh  what was the stand that you took in the 14th fc?special category status is not under the jurisdiction of any fc in my book  i have explained the centres version of the relationship between 14th fc recommendation and the special categoryif you want the simple truth  14th fc did not make any recommendation on inclusion or exclusion of special category the issue of according special category status and assurance by the pm was given months before the 14th fc could give recommendationsbut the government has its own explanation as to why it interprets the recommendations of 14th fc with regard to special category status i have given that in the book it is for the reader to decide why and how these are relatedcess is becoming a monster in the administrative system with gst we assumed that cess wont any longer be a part of the system but with kerala  we have a disaster cess isnt the purpose of a reform lost with such acts?there is a calamity fund and the centre is expected to come to the assistance of states when such things happen and there is always a burden sharing  you cant anticipate this now the recourse to cess for such things is unusualisnt this a step away from cooperative fiscal federalism? the council is telling one state that funds needed for rebuilding after a disaster are to be generated from within that statethat is why some of them are dissenting calling it coercive federalism these are innovations that some states are uncomfortable withyou have kerala at the upper end of the social development scale and uttarakhand at the lower end  tn  gujarat and maharashtra at the higher end of the economic development index with odisha and bihar at the other how is it possible for any central body  including the fc to reconcile these differences?that is exactly the issue with regard to any federation in any federation there are competing considerations you have to build trust amongst yourselves so therefore there is no fixed formula thats how you operate the systemwhat is needed is for the centre to be able to bring together the states and treat these inequalities or calamities as a national problem in which both union and states participate problem now is that whenever a state opposes the centre it is accused of being antinational being antiunion is not antinationalthere are 3 levels of debate  state interest  union interest  national interest to build a national consensus  the union and states must be together if the states get the feeling that the union has abrogated to itself the sole authority of national interest  the states resent it that is the essence of the matterhow much is this because of a strong leader at the top?you should go back to constituent assembly debates dr ambedkar when introducing the draft constitution  discusses the merits and demerits of parliamentary and presidential form of government and says why parliamentary system is important for india he says that india is essentially undemocratic and therefore emphasises on continuous accountability he says continuous accountability is more important than stability that was the deliberate choice on this type of issuein 14th fc  you recommended forest cover as a determinant in the five years that have lapsed  have you studied how that recommendation has helped indias environment cause?no but its an interesting area where we have to see the impact of the recommendation but the logic is simple  forest cover the state govt is contributing to environment at a cost to itself it cannot use the resource but has to maintain it so you have to provide for it the basic principle is externalities the state is contributing at its own cost  it does not gain anything it incurs cost to maintain the forest the hindu  https  wwwthehinducom business economy yvreddyinterview article26489119ece  ive always liked the forest cover model of assigning tax resources to the states its a very esteemable

last night and heres how the conversation panned outagent where are you from?me keralaagent oh no wonder you ordered beef do all you  kerala people eat beef?me not really but its one of our favorite dishagent are you a christian?me hinduagent then why do you eat beef ? dont you believe in god? how can you eat beef?was really taken aback by that question me umm its very common i dont find anything wrong with thatagent the other day i saw a kerala guy selling beef and he had photos of god in his shop me hmmmmmmi then went home and ate the beef fry  ordering it again tonight so good with the way things are right now  im surprised he didnt spit on your food and deliver it to you ive only eaten beef this one time and it nearly killed me the meat was nice  the lynchers on the other hand not so much im a mostlyvegetarian hindu who can eat meat if there is no veggie alternative  or if said alternative has been had three times in a row theres only so much salad i can do this isnt for moral reasons  not having grown up eating meat means that the taste and texture are still alien to me but i defend the practice of meat eating to my conservative friends and family i tell them to  a  stop being hypocritical and  b  learn about other hindus in india i point to their and their childrens leather shoes and ask whether the cow voluntarily donated its skin  and whether it continued to live after they were well shod i point to the fact that of the top six exporters of beef in the world  three are hindus what do they feel about it? millions of hindus visit the kullu dusshera festival  where animals are sacrificed and the meat is eaten as prasad the head priest of the hidimba temple does the sacrifice some of their favourite bjp politicians wear leather shoes  and some  such as sangit som  one of the most vicious antibeef proponents  have owned meatexporting companies overall  beef  exports have risen under the modi regime dm me your best place to order beef from for an average keralite beef with beef is a cultural shock its also very strange when peope talk of steak as the go to beef dish jesus christ that is why i dont feel comfortable ordering off zomato or anywhere else cause i feel like they are quitely judging my food choice but then again i am wayy to lazy to make my own food  so zomato it is its just ignorance imagine if you saw someone ordering something like an octopus you would be surprised at it  not necessarily in a malicious way  but just because its not common and is generally considered taboo youre lucky that the guy wasnt more aggressivehowever  i think its the responsibility of the companies to train their employees not to judge people or make comments about their choices was the delivery person from zomato or jomato? if zomato surprising  if jomato then bhaiyya checks out i drink alcohol and almost every time i drink socially somebody will ask tell you are a muslim  you are not allowed to we are inherently nosy judgemental people  i dont see that changing any time soon as long as nobody gets hurt   i am fine looks like this guy was genuinely curious  rather than judgemental and accusing  if yes  you might have missed a golden opportunity to convert a bhakt into a normal human being he needs to be educated on how people choices when it comes to food shouldnt be an issue for education  is something that fight against ignorance isnt basically all beef in india buffalo meat? i never understood this business ive been having beef in india all my life  but ive never seen cow meat being sold its been always buffalo meat i cant say that its true for entire country but the chances of cow meat in india being sold is still pretty low should have asked him  why they are selling it i also cooked beef today and i am a brahmin from wb beef pasanda zindabaad get this delivery guys name and tweet this conversation to zomato senior management even if they dont hold an enquiry  it will stop other delivery fellows from nosing into the habits of their customers the shaming and violence aspect comes from casteism this is completely different from the choice based vegan movement in the west hi i am part of zomatos marketing team can you please share the order id with me so that the concerned team can look into this at the earliest? thanks dont you belive in god???? you should report him to zomato its not his job to question your food choices freedom of food i dont mean this in a condescending way but why should the delivery people even know what youre ordering? thats your and

future is screwed and no one can do anything about itim starting this based on an assumption that the only way for lowermiddle income countries like india to prosper is through a manufacturingled  exportoriented economythis is the only proven model of prosperity in the 20th and 21st centuriesthis manufacturing cant be just any kind it has to be low skill  highvolume in order to employ a large number of people indias current manufacturing pattern is mostly filled with highskill  low employment products like jewellery  medicine  cars  and softwareits far easier to train 10 000 people to make iphone accessories than it is to get them to make carsbut this kind of highvolume  low skill manufacturing isnt coming to india  regardless of any policy push from the government a few reasons why#x200b 1 competitors in se asia a  have specialized in certain products  like garments in bangladesh   b  have fewer roadblocks to investment from the populace  they are autocracies or pseudodemocracies   and c  have a cultural affinity with china  such as vietnam  which makes it easier for chinese manufacturers to move shop there2 businesses are built on relationships  not just policy leverage policy makers dont get this because very few of them have ever run businesses by now  american businesses have had decadelong relationships with their chinese manufacturers these chinese manufacturers are now building factories in vietnam  laos and cambodia if you were an american business  who would you rather partner with  an unknown entity in india  or the vietnamese arm of the chinese manufacturer you know and trust?3 supply chains are hard to build and harder to optimize if you wanted to be a manufacturing power in 2020  you would have had to start work for it in 2015  not 2019 weve lost that moment4 indias regional inequality means that the states with cheap labor  bihar  up  are also the states where no one wants to invest in because of law and order problems5 indias democracy means that everything becomes much more challenging for a manufacturer  land acquisition  labor issues  etc vietnam  meanwhile  can bulldoze whatever the hell it wants to bulldoze and put up a red carpet for manufacturers6 and this might be a biased personal take  but ive felt that indian manufacturers dont have business competence ive tried to build products in india as well as china our chinese partners treated us as a small company that might later be a big company  and gave us that respect and priority our indian partner treated us as a small fry and was more keen on getting shortterm profit than build a longterm relationshipi feel that the moment where india could be a manufacturing power is past us without manufacturing  youll have a situation where#x200b 1 the state has to spend more and more on welfare to tackle unemployment among a young population2 to pay for this welfare  the state will increasingly overreach in tax collection youre seeing this already where a small section of the population pays nearly all the taxes3 the small portion of people who have good jobs will be increasingly resentful of their taxes being spent on welfare this  coupled with environmental issues  will accelerate brain drain and capital flight4 without the capital and manpower  employment generation will be even slower  forcing the state to squeeze even more if the welfare dole stops  it knows there is going to be widespread unrest 5 all this welfare will tax the state exchequer more and more were seeing this already  the government has hit its fiscal deficit target for the year in just 7 months 6 one the welfare dole stops  tens of millions of unemployed  angry  poor people will only do what they can do revolt#x200b or is there a silver lining to this cloud? all popular grievances and administrative obstacles neatly outlined financial planners have been giving the government the call for course correction but the government is tone deaf to the problems of the common man as long as dalal street is happy silver lining a lot of these points you mentioned are low hanging fruit for indian policymakers and industry for instance  the attitude problem of indian companies could change with experience  exposure and opportunities manufacturing country ship has sailed long ago the future will be driven by ai and manufacturing will be replaced by robotstake a look at any advance car manufacturer lot of work is being designated to robots and almost a skeleton crew of engineer exist to ensure products are checked to ensure they meet the standard also  know as qc quality and control joblike data entry will also be largely replaced it will exist for a long time cause they basically ride the code for a lot of these future techs we will have a lot of jobless people who need to be reskilled to meet the demands of the future we are an agriculture heavy industry another thing we boast is cheap healthcare the future lies in these two sectors develop these and you are good to go for the next 30 years or so i work in the biotech field its a highly niched field where very few products make it to the market after years of rd but biotech as such has a lot of overlap with this healthcare and agriculture lets give india 4 years by then if the government and the population show improvement then well else only option left will be to move to some other place  remember that you live only once am not gonna waste my time for people who dont wanna change themselves if we cant develop a progressive mindset only we are to blame",

have not kept our promise so  here goes we suggest the following flairs  and if there are any that you want to see added  please suggest them  askindia governance to separate policy decisions from political postsas mentioned above  please suggest new flairs that you would want to see now  lets address discussion in  r india threads  especially political posts a few ideas do note that these are only ideas  we are not implementing them we are only looking for your opinion ###political posts no direct submission to images  including memes  and twitter if you want to submit an image or a twitter post  create a selfpost and explain what is it that you want to discuss about it political discussions should be strictly  r  enforced we want to implement this  but we have fallen short because we dont have enough active moderators we would need to hire more the problem is we need to find people who have the time and inclination to do this  remove loweffort political selfposts ### nonpolitical posts same rule as politics for twitter post  and other social media screenshots including memes  specify what you want to discuss and substantiate your stand in a selfpost  r india should not be the place to discuss whatsapp forwards please feel free to disagree with all the points made here   could you improve wiki? many times a post comment is removed citing some nonexistent rule and you dont allow to make meta post about it which i can understand because you dont want drama you ask to send mod mail we send but then you dont reply to mod mails too  remove politics from this sub like  r unitedkingdom has  r ukpolitics   r canada has  r canadapolitics   r australia has  r australianpolitics etc remove political post and direct people to post in  r indianpolitics it will improve this sub make things transparent  r futurology has  r futurologymoderators  and  r futurologyremovals  where removed things are recorded with reason  r technology has has their automod configuration public  r technology wiki automoderator use a meta sub to which allows easier communication and discussions case in point  r metacanada  add this post and other mod announcement posts in the  r india wiki   deleted  no direct submission to images  including memes  and twitter if you want to submit an image or a twitter post  create a selfpost and explain what is it that you want to discuss about itif i have to explain my meme or image in a selfpost it is kind of counter intuitive  no? i mean  a picture is supposed to be worth a thousand words my two bits remove the political post politics altogether from this sub our life is teeming with enough politics already be it newspaper or news channel with blaring mindless debates airing all day and since many redditors have complained about the same in many self posts it seems like the right time to do soyou can direct those who wants to discuss that to something like  r indiapolitics if it exists or make one for them like many other countries sub did   if still you see people have this great uncontrolled urge to discuss which politician wrote what on twitter and those other shit you can always give them a warning first and if they dont comply then ban them from this sub not shadowban let them know why they are banned   id suggest some flairs like arts  sports and religion more flairs will keep different posts from getting mixed and people interested in a particular thing probably wont downvote the stuff they are not interested in and new genuine posts in their respective category will hopefully get a breathe of upvote from interested people +1 for no political twitter spam  remove loweffort political selfpostsplease elaborate on this?also  you guys to need to ensure greater transparency in your process no direct submission to images  including memes  and twitter if you want to submit an image or a twitter post  create a selfpost and explain what is it that you want to discuss about iti dont think this serves any purpose at all the reason these memes and tweet links exist is not for ops to score cool karma points  but to reinforce his her own political views so self post or not  these low effort posts would continue to clutter the feed remove loweffort political selfpostsyou will need to elaborate on this or else you are going to get accused of muzzling opinions  since there is an announcement  i want to bring up couple of points which affects the quality of discussion here  these are tangentially related             does this sub have an official stand or voice on any issue? is it a place for discussion only or reddit india supported activism?  for example net neutrality debate i think the official voice of redditindia should not get into activism irl it encourages brigading and suppressing contrary voices          i think it was wrong that redditindia took an official position on contentious issue like nn which lead to brigading in real life  shouldnt have happened            second  do we need the twitter account of redditindia to tweet hot posts? and is there a criteria i  have seen low effort self posts getting tweeted i  see that as an encouragement  ooh common account as a mod interestinggovernance flair sounds good hopefully well have more discussions on that how about a flair to seperate the faking news unreal times articles from the real news  political discussions should be strictly  r  enforced remove loweffort political selfpostsyes and yes but we have fallen short because we dont have enough active moderators we would need to hire more the problem is we need to find people who have the time and inclination to do thisany other conditions? wheeee flairs   til  lpt jugaad  eli 5  itap  tomt  throwback for old awesome posts that newcomers can enjoy like out of loop     but can we also have something against down voting self posts into oblivion?       removed  you people tried to moderate political thread last time as well it didnt work politics is the major subject on this sub and unless you double the moderators keeping political posts strictly r enforced will be hard   removed  having to explain memes kind of spoil the fun and that also kind of deters the content makes  who am i kidding  no randian makes original content  even then  atleast its possible in the future aand thats how you make a dead subbtw instead of these useless flairs why not make a delhi flair to filter it out all the useless aap posts i have a moderation related questions   when moderators delete a post  i have seen 3 kinds of things happening1 a comment is posted to the thread about why it was deleted   2 a  deleted  message appear on the self post    3 sometimes neither of the 2 happen  but the post still disappears    so whats the difference? why not a message in the thread any time a post is deleted by moderation?    add a flair for geopolitics  askindia is good but i dont think governance flair would be used often rather  have a weekly flair for regular posts another suggestion  have a bjp aap congress flair along with political a lot of people want to read political news not related to these 3 parties", "tokenized":

it in indian context the arguments go something to the tune of  you had the best of times  the best jobs  social security  economic growth and are now becoming an impediment to education subsidies and liberal policies that will benefit the present youthin the indian context  these arguments are only partially true firstly  the word boomer refers to baby boomers generation born post wwii  19461964  this was the period where the great healthcare became accessible to everyone in developed nations and the child mortality dropped fast however  the birthrates remained relatively high  though decreasing  and this led to high number of kids being born this was the golden period of american growth  women and boomers then joined labor force and there was a great productivity rise in labor middleclass grew and moved to suburbs and could live that idylic existence with benefits of big cities as well as countryside boomers led a positive existence  not just that  because the birthrates decreased subsequently  boomers also had disproportionate power as a voting block  which was bolstered by the fact that the voting  in boomers is much higher than in subsequent generations too  so  they could bring about and keep laws which were in line with their values but were oldfashioned according to their successors moreover  older people living on savings hate increase in inflation that comes with debtfueled government spendings so  it was natural for this generation to be debt hawks which also meant opposition to subsidies which led to rise in education debt amongst younger generationhence  it is a legitimate cause of angst for politically savvy young people who are forced to live in a society controlled by the oldies who support arcane laws  against abortion for instance  and go against their benefits  education subsidies however  india has a completely different demographic profile purely  in terms of being the largest generation  we are the boomers of india we were born around or just before the high growth postliberalization india  have opportunities  in terms of private sector jobs  access to information  that the older generation did not have  boomers had booming economy whereas their parents had depression and war  even as a political block  the young people have the biggest electoral power amongst all generations  a power that was partially harnessed by bjp when they won two elections  moreover  with the dropping birthrates in india  we would also grow old in an era of depressed population growth where we continue to be the most influential generation  just like the boomershowever  it is also true that the older generation is more bigoted  religiously castewise minded than us and have a role in morally bankrupt polity in this country there is some blame that we can certainly lay on the older generation but  the whole boomer spiel of the west wherein the millennial generation claims that the boomers had a much better life and are now actively spoiling the present and future of current youth is certainly not applicable here our parents generation had a life of scarcity in terms of resources and opportunities even if you are not interested in reading history or talking to your parents  just watch movies  heroes or characters who were struggling to find work  were getting rejected because they could not pay bribes were part of every story apart from government jobs  any city apart from tieri had little to no opportunities in the licenseraj era statistically  there was lower economic growth and more povertyto see the claims about the older generation led a great life is ridiculous however  it is true that the young need to break free of the religious and caste fundamentalism that the older generation were a victim of due to their lack of exposure and programming so i can say ok boomer to my casteist uncle?  https  wwwyoutubecom watch?v0vkz8y_9vu4  https  wwwyoutubecom watch?v0vkz8y_9vu4 had to do it look at the price of a home in the current market and look at it 30 years ago look at the price of an education today and look at it 30 years ago its quite similar to the situation in america", "tokenized": [101,

who are rich and have a lot to lose have the most incentive to not rock the boat you may disagree with them and wish they would stand up for the aam junta  but realistically  they tend to be the last to speak up against government atrocity so instead of jumping down their throats  acknowledge that any of them coming forward like this is a sign that the struggle against the urban nazis is getting more and more popular support theyd not be traced because they were masked  and were blessed by the so called power maybe if you guys stopped donating to party funds it would really help well atleast more people will slowly stand up against what is happening in this nation like i saw in one of the other pics right now it so bad  even the bhakts are protestingthose videos sent a chill down my spine i was a carefree guy during college was only worried about exams  cricket  anime and video games if armed goons came to my hostel  i would be so confused  scared and have no idea what to do i am so sorry university kids had to go through this your politics do matter  right wingers will rejoice in this atrocity these businessmen are the biggest enablers of fascism in india they are the worst affected given the state of our economy yet they dont have the spine to stand up and call out the incompetent bunch running the governmenthere he probably is using this incident as a cover to attack the govt  but he is still chickening out from calling the power out he just took a neutral stand speaking something against something wrong  took a safe stand isnt the fact that no one got detained and there are videos of goons being escorted out enough proof who did it? this is where new money and old money differs the latter isnt really accustomed to praise and clap for somebody for no apparent reason  just like rahul bajaj had said in that famous incident dear industry leaders  please speak up against this bullshit this is plain and simple astroturfing sabko pata h bc kisne kiya

people  it was an enjoyable ama with all thanks for the interesting questions hope was able to answer all the questions with this i close this discussion  deleted  please share some incidents which you feel are misandry in society  hello amit         a couple of questions        1  women rights get a lot of funding i work for a big fmcg client  a big csr fund is allocated to women empowerment activities how is the funding scene for ngos who work for mens rights?       2  with whatever experience you have  do you think the judiciary is totally fair impartial when dealing with false cases of dowry  rapes etc?  deleted  this was a pretty hard letdown of an ama op had the chance to show mras are serious about mens rights but ended up with the same ol misogynistic  antifeminist views weve seen time and time againhighlightsand what relief does a woman who is in distress after being raped within marriage get by jailing the husband? how do you educate people misandry is a thing? just educate them that womens rights are not continuously being trampled upon when comparing mens and womens rights  do you believe that one deserves more attention than the other? do you consider issues like mental health problems like depression  anxiety among males  and the pressure to have a masculine   macho image etc a priority  and what is your take on tackling them ? what are your views on the lack of laws against martial rape? if you are against criminalization of martial rape  could you please tell me why? do you have numbers on men being falsely accused? if not  do you plan on conducting a study to gather these numbers?mens rights activism has attracted some of the vilest misogynists of the world to its cause  what are your views on these men?what steps has your organization taken in changing the law that basically declares that men cannot be raped? also about raya sarkars list of sexual predators  are you for or against it? in a country where womens rights are continuously trampled upon and men are continuously accused of promoting a patriarchal society  how do you convince people that misandry is a thing too? what do you think of the meninism ?https  enwikipediaorg wiki meninism what are your views on martial rape? ive come across a lot mra keyboard warriors  who seemed reasonable people fighting for a good cause  only to find out that theyre just plain redpill seduction community influenced misogynists how often does this happen with you? i assume it must be infuriating to have misogynists trying to hijack your cause and using it as a shield i would like to refer to you a comment in a  thread made a while back  https  wwwredditcom r india comments 7a1zx0 men_of_randia_were_you_ever_assaulted dp6ijdo now if you notice in a comment further he says the main issue was that the guys have difficulty in even admitting that  it happened  https  wwwredditcom r india comments 7a1zx0 men_of_randia_were_you_ever_assaulted dp6lr8q  probably because of the shameso i want to know what you guys think is the best ways to change this type of mentality among men themselves? and how underreported is sexual violence against men?  misandry is as bad as misogyny  tc apply  https  wwwredditcom r india comments 7dcctp lets_slay_misandry_hi_guys_i_am_amit_deshpande_a dpwso4n ?stja2o9b5zsh24869092  from your website i came to know of a suicide helpline for men that your organisation runs can you tell us more about it? hi amit ji  so what do you think is going wrong the system or the society? also  should all men and families be worried? what can education ministry do to reduce dropouts among boys i cant believe randia gave a platform to this guy hes an incel in real life just read the stuff he writes  i have seen men on whom false cases of dowry harrasment and domestic violence is slapped  although they havent taken any dowry in order to harrasment them because this usually comes with a demand for alimony or maintenance i also see them being blackmailed coldmindedly by this they have a tendency settle the cases with hefty amounts of alimony because this affects their daily schedule of work and they find it difficult to continue to work they say that if they continue litigation to prove their point  they will lose out on precious years of their liveswhat suggestions or advice would you give to such men? how should they cope up with the stress involved? moreover what should be done so that justice prevails and one doesnt support and encourage false case accusers by settling the disputes outside courts as this gives a wrong picture to the society and govt? hey amit first of all  you are doing a great jobwhat inspired you to get into mra?", "tokenized": [101, 11082, 22889, 4710, 28616, 5685, 2854, 7632, 4364, 1045, 2572,

science awesome i read about this sometime back  but it was speculation and not the conclusion of a study thenanyone interested in reading viewpoints such as of these researchers should read the indian clerk  a book about ramanujan and his time in england people are arguing that the taylor series was proof of invention of calculus bitch pls be proud if you want to but get your facts rightwhile i understand that the taylor series is a very important concept in calculus  it isnt necessary to combine the ideas of infinitesimal sums and differences  convergence  divergence and limits to get to it the form newton and leibnitz fought over inventing was one which had these concepts  as evidenced by newton promptly using it for his kinematics work so no  in the true sense  i wouldnt call this the invention of calculus but its an absolutely important step there nonetheless something which neither newton nor leibnitz had set eyes on  so careful before you start accusing them of plagiarizing  these are real indian achievements i have no idea why the wingnuts insist on tomtomming the taj as a shiv mandir when there actually are real things to be proud of  really  this is new? i thought madhava and the taylor series has been known for a quite a while now newton wasnt even the 1st european to develop the calculus  a better title would be medieval scientists in kerala invented infinite series centuries before the westthis is indeed admirable  but please do remember that calculus isnt just about infinite series  the concept of limits  infinitesimal small changes and their infinite sums is crucial infinite series is just one part of the stepping stones to calculusregardless  this is definitely something to be proud about its interesting to see proper research into the indian history of the maths  sciences and economics  since this is severely lacking in our narratives of history however  using clickbaity headlines is a bit disingenuous  but to be expected it is a 2007 article  going by the datethere were many reasons why the contribution of the kerala school has not been acknowledged  he said a prime reason is neglect of scientific ideas emanating from the noneuropean world  a legacy of european colonialism and beyondhowever  he concedes there are other factors also in playthere is also little knowledge of the medieval form of the local language of kerala  malayalam  in which some of most seminal texts  such as the yuktibhasa  from much of the documentation of this remarkable mathematics is written  he admitsi think mr gevarghese george  who sounds like an indian  has got his primes mixed up the brits were rather interested in what we had discovered and what we believed  if the journal of the asiatic society is anything to go by i would say that the prime reason is what he accepts as other factors  something for which the blame lies squarely at our own feeti think we have done much more than just this  in advanced mathematics and astronomy and then let it all go to seed  this is mentioned in wikipedia in the 14th century  indian mathematician madhava of sangamagrama and the kerala school of astronomy and mathematics stated components of calculus such as the taylor series and infinite series approximations however  they were not able to combine many differing ideas under the two unifying themes of the derivative and the integral  show the connection between the two  and turn calculus into the powerful problemsolving tool we have todaythe researcher of this article is george gheverghese joseph from kerala  v invanted calculuss  removed  shocked that i havent seen a so prod v invant comment here so far anyway  now that western scientists have put this matter to rest  i am sure our fellow randians are convinced otherwise we would have seen a bunch of disparaging comments about the people who say anything along these lines secular feathers will be ruffled kya ukhaad liya calculus invent karke everytime someone comes out with statements like this  especially if they are right   the natural question that arises is  then what the f are we doing with our garbage heap of an education system  rote learning  utter absence of creativity  and spectacles like a daytime drama queen  literally  as the person in charge of education  chokehold of bureaucracy  anaemic support for higher education  and research  07 vs 3 of gdp that all of our competitors have ? it must have been invented we had a very skilled and glorious past even scientists today r baffled by indian architecture which was created in past the ashoka pillar is the iron pillar standing in open since years without any rust  and taj mahal ajanta ellora paintings etcetc but sad truth is today we are a third world country with poverty population explosion and corruption just coz ur father was a rich n successfull businessman doesnt mean u keep on doing nothing and encash on his name hope this is clear not sure  why we always want to compare our civilization with western one seems like we still have the inferiority complex because western one ruled over us we know  india is one of the oldest and great civilization a lot of was discovered and invented in india but can we focus on how what we are today even if calculus was created in india  no one can deny that leibniz  newton and western civilization reinvented it  documented it  promoted it  applied it and made it part of math curriculum so even if india  created calculus  stop finding reasons for how great we were  and discuss on how can be great today calculus is indianmlecch_certified where is the anti kulcha people now doesnt matter  because issac newton was indian too he was kidnapped from yamuna vaidhshalaya  university  and brainwashed by white people his real name was isayu nathuram look it up on subramanian swamys facebook page if you dont beleive me so we inveneted calculus either way so prod of r kulcha doesnt matter issac newton  ishant nutan  was actually of indian origin his father had emigrated from india  that is why his father forced ishant to learn sanskrit which was responsible for ishant creating calculus itt  not history not a lot of math  does not compute at all", "tokenized": [101, 19276, 2580, 1999, 2634, 5539, 2086, 2077, 8446, 2817, 2974, 2671, 12476, 1045, 3191, 2055, 2023, 8811, 2067, 2021, 2009, 2001,

the highlightsthe biggest takeaway was the direct attack on what the survey calls anglosaxon economics basically the concept of a general equilibrium theory instead it claims an economy is always within either a virtous cycle or a vicious cycle a virtous cycle is characterised by rising investment  rising exports and rising savings a vicious cycle is the inverse of that the implication is that the government must intervene to steady the ship and any fantasy about rational actors has to be abandonedthe importance of higher savings cannot be underestimated accoring to the survey it is only with high and rising savings that a country can selffinance high investments otherwise it must seek out foreign savings which gets translated into a high current account deficit which in turn makes it vulnerable during times of crises they survey continually made mention of china and other fastgrowing east asian economies when making its case in countless graphs it is clear what the chief inspiration is having very high savings naturally means having a correspondingly low domestic consumption thus  the only way to have fast growth when domestic consumption is subdued is through fast export growth they survey made the case that because india still has a low share of world export market so there is plenty of scope to regain  regardless of trade tensionsthe survey made many other recommendations  of which judicial reform is one which caught my one  but the overriding theme of the survey was the call to abandon anglosaxon economics  by which it meant general equilibrium theory itll be interesting to see if india truly makes a decisive economic policy break from the past as the language suggests based on your summary   and good of you to make the effort  the economic survey is goobleydook if theyre busy saying general equilibrium theory is anglo saxon economics  and somehow behavioral stuff is not?  then its some weird waste of time in the you arent even wrong kind of badim going to go read it now one else has to waste their time on this shit literally  r badeconomics thank you for your service to the nation one of the worst economic surveys ever in the recent years it was expected  given how the current cea got his job https  enwikipediaorg wiki krishnamurthy_subramanian#careerin articles published in the times of india and livemint titled  will black be

banknote demonetisation policy in 2016 what didnt catch your eye1 nudge economics and excessive stress on behavioural economics  it seems like a kind of foreshadowing and a prelude to excuses for data theft2 after speaking few pages on gibberish on big data and data  the govt reiterates the same lines as it did before aadhar judgment sovereignty of data  state security and providing cheap data to corporates while again  using the garb of security and ease of biz3 all the wanking on beti bachao beti padhao being an immense success and swacchh bharat being a great success sorry to let you know  the chapters seemed kind of promotion than anything related to policy prescription thats quite a downgrade  even under ndas standards  given i havent missed an es since 20144 for all the bashing of anglo saxon economics do yourself a favor pick up es 2018  book 1 see chapter 1 or chapter 2  basically the big chapter  in one of the boxes  where it compares to usa and then later in another of the chapters  where it compares savings and investment slowdowns across economies  it shamelessly uses rodriks theory and proves  india shouldnt give a damn about savings rate this time it did a 180  bro

whatsapp is a major source of disinformation in our country to help mitigate this  ive created a bot that crowdsources information on fake whatsapp forwards it works with text  photos  videos  audio clips  etcwanna try it out? send any fake forwards that you have received to +14704378045  over whatsapp  please encourage any gullible friends you might have to try it tooits a little bit volatile at the moment  blame facebook for making automation difficult  and goes down from time to time please be patient if this happens  it is scheduled to restart at 530 am ist everydaycomments and suggestions welcomeedit 2many people are asking how the bot stops fake news  so im copy pasting my explanation here there are two main scenarios1 you receive a whatsapp forward which you know is factually fake and want to report it you can forward the message to this bot and report it as fake  and leave a note as to why you think its fake2 you receive a whatsapp forward and want to check if its genuine before believing it passing it on you can forward it to the bot  and the bot will inform you how many people have reported it as fake and their reasons for doing soinspired by  u onosmosis  https  wwwredditcom u onosmosis  edit thanks for the gold make a bot for other subs on reddit too if you know want i mean what does it do? how does it stop fake news? massive privacy concert alert  but here goes make it so that the number can be added to a group if any url or text that matches a known fake news hash is shared in that group  not replies to it with facts how does it stop the fake news? when storing this number in contacts it assumes this is a usa   atlanta number is this correct? i dont understand how this stops fake news being spread fwiu  its only a crowd sourced fact checker for people who want to use verify  something doesnt prevent people from forwarding the message anyway upboted for visibility great idea but what if itcell people reports fake news as fact and fact as fake? did you manage to get it running again? i feel now  more than ever  we need something like this is this down right now? how does your bot treat ambiguity? lets say a message is received where the text is found to be fake but a supported attachment media file is genuine how does forwarding it to your bot number stop fake news?", "tokenized": [101, 7632, 1054, 2634, 1045, 2081, 1037, 28516,

government  ministerseditwow getting downvoted without a debate on this keyword modi is trigger for downvoting? modiji understands the iq of indian society very well   sell them dreams and victim complex  rule forever     deleted   removed   removed   removed  is that benaami donation clause honestly in the finance bill that got squeezed through ls? feels like people have kind of moved on from that particular fuckeryedit a word developments in the supreme court heights of desperation nobody has literally any control over the supreme court it is the most opaque arm of our state  always has been stop blaming random shit on modi  your entire argument loses value because you pull shit like this cant believe people just automatically upvote anything anti modi without even reading the bs in the post so it wasnt since the time of indira gandhi?modi is the result of the bullshit spawned by congress over the years now  we have the other side corrupting the system to suit their agendai dont like modi but i hate congress worse  the same sc cji ruled in favour of aap govt in the lg aap turf war and why are you blaming modi  sc judges are appointed by collegium  not our pm yes  there are several videos and reports which are not from the left per se its even from centerists who argue thisalso  you forgot electoral bonds  which is completely annonmyous way of paying a partywhat factions usually do is try to remove blame from modi  and pin in on the preexisting system  absolving the leadership of everything this is a problem because  the leaderships inaction  ratherits tweeks to more streamline the process  is in cahoots with the preexisting system of corruptiontechnically  the present government has not done as much damage as previous ones  but small steps it has taken to legalize corruption  will lead our nation to further ruini am sure thats what our founding fathers would have wanted  my father  let my country be led to ruin   s  generally i think that the more autocratic a government is the more corruption flourishes this is because fewer people have more power  and so can do bigger scams  and because they face less risks of repercussions i read somewhere that corruption in india really kicked off with indira gandhi  precisely because she was the first leader to centralise a lot of power in just her close advisors allies corruption has been a hallmark of indian businesses and politicians way before modi  its like part of its culture and fabric of scoiety that corruption has to exist for things to run at alleven some people told me that without corruption  things cant function at all in india  it just depends on whether its big or small yeah  it was evident long ago hes mastered the art of normalizing corruption they dont even have to hide it thats why you dont hear about any scams at all these days if you dont find a view correct please put counter arguments downvoting only shows your confirmation bias yes its pretty good but im hoping with more years in power im hoping they dont make it a competition between people on the ground like the congress did being a modi supporter i always believed that modi is doing grate thing for our future but from past 6 months show different result and different future modi made black money go away as he promised but in process of making policy of making black money harder  he just made making black money a legal and tax paying due to the policy other people were abel to increase profits margins which eventually lead to high rate of products and an increase in dearness now due to gst and other policies all the product are almost double in price yes  thats the gujarat model more money reaches up  less remains for down guys is systemic appropriate in this case? isnt it supposed to be more of a biological medical term? can some vocabulary nazis help out ? i think modi is doing good job and people know that and appreciates him and thus is voting more and more bjp#acchedinforeva i would happily blame pm modi for this but corruption has been the system in developing world long before he got the top job he is making both corruption and genocides systematic", "tokenized": [101,

coronavirusindiatiktokwhatsappvideosbeingusedtomisleadpeopleoncoronavirussaypolice2205317  new delhi from videos advising people not to follow social distancing rules to those suggesting muslims are immune to coronavirus  the delhi police say they have uncovered a concerted misinformation campaign that poses a serious challenge to the governments efforts to contain the ongoing pandemic in an investigation of the content being shared on whatsapp and apps like tiktok in the first week of the nationwide lockdown  the delhi police said they have found many of the videos specifically targeting the muslim community by quoting religious text and leaders an analysis of more than 30 000 videos on the social networking over the last five days found that most of the fake information and posts are created in hindi and urdu for a specific audience  the police said the videos were analysed by the police with the help of security researchers  fact checkers and data analysts and a report on the digital investigation has been accessed by ndtv according to early estimates  more than 1 crore people have already seen these videos  suggesting a high degree of circulation and impact several of these videos appear to be shot in pakistan and middle east but audio in hindi has been superimposed to make it look like its shot in india  the 22page report  which the delhi police has shared with various intelligence agencies  says our analysis has revealed an alarming number of videos are being shared advising muslims not to practice social distancing and several suggesting that coronavirus does not kill muslims  a senior police official said according to him  the analysis also revealed a pattern in dissemination of misinformation while analysing the origins and sources of these videos  it was observed that several of the accounts which originally created them are being deleted regularly after the content goes viral to hide its origin  he said considering the fact that most of these videos have been created with professional video editing software  being viralled  sic  on social media platforms  original uploader accounts being deleted  and certain accounts peddling fake news among muslims are promoting pakistani religious leaders with terror links a further investigation into the likely role of foreign actors needs to be investigated  the report says according to the investigation  chineseowned video sharing app tiktok is the most preferred medium for creating and spreading videos with religious instigations against health advisories and fake information regarding the coronavirus these videos are further being shared on whatsapp  facebook and twitter videos of muslims refusing to get themselves tested and beating medical personnel were being spread and others were also being encouraged to do the same  the report says religious texts are being quoted to not stop shaking hands and people are being encouraged to go to their religious shrines even during lockdown  it adds authorities have expressed concern about the impact of these videos amid attacks on medical personnel like in madhya pradeshs indore this week and the emergence of a cluster in delhi because of a gathering held by a muslim missionary group last month that has spawned dozens of cases across the country in the investigation into the delhi congregation  the police are looking into a sermon allegedly by the chief cleric of the group tablighi jamaat that termed the directions of doctors as a conspiracy to keep muslims away from fellow muslims since then  maulana saad kandhalvi has officially issued an audio message to his followers asking them to cooperate with the government to fight the disease we have to take precautions  follow the guidance of the doctors and give full support to the government such as not crowding into places this is not against the principles of islam  he said while at around 2 000 cases and 53 deaths  the spread of coronavirus in india is far more limited than in europe and the us  health experts have warned that the numbers could surge across the country if the contagion takes root https  wwwaltnewsin

the article on searching google with the keywords muslims licking plates  we came across the same video on vimeo  uploaded on 31 july 2018 by a user called asghar vasanwala according to the description of the video  the people seen in the video are dawoodi bohras  who are licking the utensils in an attempt to follow their belief of zero wastage of foodfurthermore  the website of the dawoodi bohras states that they follow a tradition of eating meals on a steel thaal  which is designed to accommodate a group of 8 or 9 people they also strictly follow a policy of no wastage of food  bohras have a nowastage policy so not a single morsel should be left on the thaal when it is taken away wait till those guys see the water used in pani puris covid 19 is a virus that hopefully would be cured   communal hatred  is deeprooted in india  aint no cure for that  shit  a friend of mine who hasnt messaged me in months randomly sent me one of these videos and said take care  because of these people we will all get sick we need to do something about them its utter bullshit im a brahmin hindu  and i know my kin welltheyll find any germ or healthrelated excuse they can to fuck over muslims very important question these could be staged  doctored or old  or it could be new and true whats disturbing is that many people arent interested in verifying the sources  and a question like yours assumes you support that kind of behavior and is in denial of the truth but given the extent of hatred and division across the country  it is the question to ask goes against the agenda though there is another video circulating where a fruit seller appears to be licking his fingers as he rearranges fruits in his cart if there is a nonmalevolent interpretation for this  please do share  as

corporate tax rate may implybefore getting bombarded  let me say that it is what if scenario which is rather pessimistic but a possibility nonetheless  and i vehemently believe that we are facing growth recession if not outright recession as of now 1  lack of new job creation  decrease in purchasing power  negligible increase in either headline inflation or core inflation  23 gdp growth rate  if we calculate gdp using previous base year  has substantiated that we are or are heading to recession recession doesnt always mean negative gdp growth rate 2  uncertain and draconian policy  fast changing policies which have proved to be bereft of commitment by actual spending and pervading religious divide and ideology is eating away a part of budgetdamocles sword3  infrastructure projects underway  but for whome? bullet train  statues and home creation  but none of them are infrastructure investment which will help economy at scale and will come out to bite few years later4  migrating tendency  large mobilisation by semielite and educated group due to ease of getting residential cards given that you are competent it should increase by substantial amount after global economy slow down is over and again will bite back later due to the fact that with lack of skilled man power fewer companies will investdeflation  lack of buffer and misguided policies5  corporation tax cut  current situation is because of lack of purchasing power even among those who are employed and even a cursory glance at past will tell that india has never seen tickle down impact so i dont expect increase in pp 1  it will fail to attract new investment 2  goods may get cheaper which will lead to deflation6  possible deflation  with lack of buffer and policy failure  we will spiral down to deflation and products will get cheaper but people will start losing jobs at hitherto ratenew minted currency as catalyst to breaking economic cycle and perhaps for even worse 7  bottleneck inflation leading to stagflation  demand will stay the same or may even increase while infrastructure will be severely lacking and to boost economy  we may see new minted currencies and it will lead to rising prices inflation  but job loss will still stay the same 8  lack of foreign investment  above should be enough to deter any large fdi flow global currency inr will get devalued significantly to attract investment and will further push outward mobilisation  deleted  things certainly look shitty but it may be too early to call it a doomsday kind of scenario  govt fucked up and have realized their mistakes  they are too egoistic to admit their mistakes but have reverted back some of their shitty moves  the corporate tax cut is not going to fix demand issues directly or right away but can help attract some of the investments moving out of china that can be a huge plus in the years to comebullet train looks like a white elephant currently but if you think  wouldnt be great to have world class trains here like other developed countries?  and not just for ornamental reasons or for the politics of it  imagine the growth of business if bangalore  chennai or other similar places  the travel can be done within 2 hours?  infrastructure investments otherwise is a good thing  the roadways  tunnels and waterways will help future generations  if anything we need to have even more infra development projects  dont we love the infra of foreign countries?  these projects dont happen over night and need hige amount of planning and vision infra projects also provide employment to thousands of people  which helps with gdp and helping with demand side issuesmigration has always been a thing there is nothing new about it all the people participating in howdy modi are people who migrated out of the country looking for better prospects isnt it?  it may be another topic all together that they assume it to be their moral and birth right to comment on what is good or bad for india we are country of 13 billion people  few crores people migrating will not necessarily hurt us if at all it can help bring in remittance  yes  brain drain is a thing it has been around for generations and i dont see it reducing anytime soon  perhaps spreading of rightwingers govt everywhere in the world may mitigate it a bit due to racism etcyes  there are draconian policies and misadventures like demon  shitty gst implementation  ugly and useless statues etc but good economics does not necessarily mean good politics  and to win elections  one needs good politics and optics  the wrath of the market forced govt to rollback some of their shitty policies  the euphoria behind corp tax cut may not last forever  and pure economics may start playing  and as i started off  it may

right place to ask these kind of questions  please remove this if its in the wrong subreddit### so this is my situationi on the last round of interview for an irish company and i dont have a passport yet   i know its dumb   so i applied for the passport and went to the passport office today and my application got rejected due to the lack of identification documentsi went there with 3 docs aadhar  pan and my sslc certificatei only have aadhar  and pan card as identification docs   i have voters id but the name in there is spelled wrong   so the mam at the counter told me if there is any other documents i have  and suggested that i can get a online birth certificate so i went to the near by cafe and took a print out of the birth certificate but in that  my name was given with out my initials so the assistant passport officer rejected my application so when i went back to ask what else i can do  the mam at the counter told me that if i applied for non tatkal passport i will need only two identification documents   plus sslc certificate   so i came back home and went to nearest eseva kendra to reapply for the passport in  non tatkal way## problem 2imagine my name is michael jackson obamaso in my sslc certificate my name is written as michael jo and in my aadhar and pan card its written as michael jackson obama  so he says that i cannot apply passport like this i have to change my name in the sslc certificate to match my aadhar q1 but the passport officer didnt mention any of these is that problem ? changing my name in my sslc could take up to a couple of weeks but if it takes that long i could lose my jobi currently dont have licence q2 what are my options for getting a passport asap ?edit  10 03 2020i went to meet my uncles friend who has some knowledge on these things so i have been told that there will be no problem for me to apply passport via non tatkal route since my name on the pan card and aadhar is just expanded form of my name in the sslc certificate so that wont be a problem appointment for the passport office has been scheduled at 16th march so i will post what happens nextedit  16 04 2020i finished the interview in the passport office with out any trouble they asked me which name i want in my passport michael jo or michael jackson obama so the whole process was over under 45mins so waiting for police verification now sorry for this  unethical suggestion contact a broker he will take some extra money and get the job donehe might charge you extra to get the name changed in aadhar and pan according to your sslc certificatebrokers have contacts who can get things done with as few requirements as possible hey man i have a similar problem i asked about it here a while back you can check on my profilei havent applied for a passport yet but i got an affidavit published in the state gazette that both my names on aadhar card and ssc certificate are the same so im gonna use that when i do applywould you mind if i dm you

question for the doctors of this subreddit or anyone who can answer it with any kind of authority personal anecdotes wont really help me muchso every indian parent has always been a strong advocate of drinking warm water or hot water and all kinds of other shit like milk with turmeric or gargling regularly even before the virus but now they have more ammunition now you have to do these things if you want to beat the virus i also want to include vitamin c tablets to the purview of this question as they boost immunity im not going to argue against whatever health benefits these things might have normally im sure theyre great but my dad has a whatsapp recording of some guy who has a friend in china  idfk as if that claim makes the recording more authentic  where the guy goes through a list of things to help you prep against the virus he makes a case for how warm water doesnt let mucus collect and takes it to your stomach where gastric acids deal w it and says to avoid cold foods during these times alnd take vit c and gargle regularlyi guess my question how exactly do these things help against the virus  if at all?  and if they dont how do i convince my parents to calm down?i also want to add the reason for my cynicism is ive heard doctors say that you can try supplements for improving immunity but nothing can really help you from getting the virus and dont cold foods only worsen the symptoms of an existing cold virus instead of causing it? no one is implying eating ice cream will give you corona but their implication is that eating cold foods will make you weak against corona i hope i can get a definite answer out of this that i can carry around for the rest of my life drinking warm water or hot waterthis is a myth we are warm blooded animal homeostasis  milk with turmericturmeric has anti microbial property about garglinggargling works on a simple phenomenon ie plasmolysis but do remember to add saltotherwise gargling is uselessvit cyes its good for immunity but regular and gradual intake of vit c helps in enhancing immunity my dad isnt letting me keep water in the fridgefuck these stupid fucking retarded ass whatsapp forwards if digesting mucous by gastric juices could cure covid19  then mucolytics would have been the first line therapynebuliser and mucolytics  bam sarscov2 why not look at fact checking sites or reputable media sites before asking for verification of putrid whatsapp claims? each of these have been debunked multiple timesfailing that  listen to the pm this is not a time for home remedies and this bs about cold foods is irritating common cold and influenza are caused by coronaviruses  which dont give a st about what youve eaten dairy  though  can thicken your mucus which can cause problems when you have a cold edited although the thickening effect is called out as false in many scientific papers  which point to an allergenic effect instead", "tokenized": [101, 5948, 2980, 2300, 9992, 3147, 9440, 17463, 2005, 1996,

participation of locals also  their staff are directly involved in these training activites  kinda makes the whole experience great more than a shop  it gives a socialising platform in sports field thank you decathlon  for once you are making arrogant sportswear makers like nike  adidas  puma  asics  nb nervous  these people have made their products like 50 100  more expensive in india as compared to the west  largely making common products out of reach for the middle class  nike shoes which are just common wear in the west is overpriced here and is supposed to be a fashion statement so much so that when nri travel to india they bring shoes as gifts to please my family for context a 100  asics running shoe is  rs14000 in india what kind of business model is this? im going to decathlon for sure til decathlon is french  deleted  decalathon replaced my 4 month old shoes under warranty   fuk u adidas i dont know of anyones been to decathlons in bangalore but somehow in all of them  the helper staff seem like well off upper middle class people in their 20s  you can tell from the way they speak and dress  their english is like those south bombay kids i have even seen foreigners work as staff this is very weird because you dont see people who are well off doing jobs that are considered menial by a lot of people does decathlon pay really well or something reduced visits to decathlon  because i end up spending more than i need to the assortment is so good and the quality is first class i just live their shop man so big and they let you try and play with things even the employees at store are so friendly and helpful i wish more brands adopt this style  im hopping ikea has similar experience the store in thane had very friendly environment  they trusted customers and ive seen so many times people shoplifting so they had to start tagging and deploying security at stores thats just sad these adidas  nike  puma deserve this decathlon cares about sports more than moneymaking i fucking love decathlon amazing quality stuff at great prices i just wish they make a shopping app or at least do something w their website its really buggy or something decathlon  the hamleys for adults whats the difference between their dry  dry+ and dry+ breathe running t shirts? i heard great things about them from my buddies  so their word of mouth advertising seems to be working well   will have to visit one day it is pronounced dikathlo if anyone is interested i just love decathlon for their product quality and excellent pricing its my go to shop for shoes clothes and basic sport goods i have met many disabled employees at the pune store  and im sure they proactively encourage and hire  which really improves their brand image in front of me most

tribe communities muslims and reservation are two distractions used by indian elites to confuse people these two are blamed for all of indias problems and people are stupid enough to believe it honestly  as a dalit i sometimes wish let them remove reservation then let them explain to masses how 1 indians are getting 73 indian wealth within decade there will be riots in streets and true people responsible for indian poverty will be found out sizable dalit tribal population doesnt understand how system is rigged against them  they think reservation is making some difference these guys can finally wake up you have 225 reservation for 29 sc st in government jobs which are just 4 of total jobs and people think this is useful or something the main question we need to ask is where are the damn jobs ? i have said previously that scheduled castes and tribes are next on the list after muslimslooks like i was wrong theyre targeting everyone at the same time  just with a different approach the other problem is also the courts selective affirmation of the states discretionary powers for providing reservations when it comes to a decision not to provide reservations  the court feels the state has absolute discretion and need not collect data to justify this decision but when the state wants to provide quotas  the court brings in the concept of equality and places several restrictions that dilute the discretionary power of the state the 50 ceiling for quotas is an example of this restrictionthis alone is enough to show how the supreme court is disingenuous and biased as hell and their end goal isnt equality of any sorts first they stopped making it compulsory for promotion in government jobs and now will give only lower level jobs to reservationssecond they stopped compulsory arrest in sc st act and will give pree arrest anticipatory bail to the accusedthis is the destruction of the act itself bc reservation is not the government spooge to give its a bloody constitutional right get that modi shah i wish the govt does try fucking around with the reservations i truly pray that they somehow think that by making their stooges pass such judgements that they can alter the basic tenets of reservations and try curtailing it it will be the end of this govt period come on bjp rss try messing with reservations please you can do it show us how tough you are first moslems   now sc st   good job bjp judiciary  govt  golly what is with this government? talk to upper caste  and they believe bjp is shit and giving sc st everything talk to sc st  they say its upper caste partywho the fuck voted for these mfs? i believe reservations  should be based on economic conditions and not on castethe reason is many scs and sts have a high family income yet take advantage of reservationon the other hand there are many general candidates that have very low family income yet have no such advantagereservations if any  should be used to lift the distressed classes and not lift the already uplifted", "tokenized": [101, 2339, 1996, 4259, 5434, 14392, 2006, 8040, 2358, 20563, 2015, 2038, 2580, 1037, 2576, 4040, 2009, 2038, 16813, 1996, 2163, 4204, 2000,

didnt see a single paisa of this money is because the fifteenth finance commission  xvfc  has not included delhi in its recommendations this is because delhi is not a state the finance commission  a constitutional body  deals with financial relations between the union government and state governmentsdeep divethe xvfc recommended creation of a new disaster mitigation and response fund  at union  ndrmf  and state levels  sdrmfs these new funds are distinct from the og  national disaster response fund  ndrf  and sdrfs under the disaster management act  2005 the ndrf and srdfs are for meeting expenses for emergency response  relief  and rehabilitation due to any threatening disaster situation or disasterthe ndrmf and sdrmf are for local level and communitybased interventions which reduce risks and promote environmentallyfriendly settlements and livelihood practices large scale mitigation will continue to be addressed by broad developmental programs and policies of the union and state governmentsnote 1 the difference here lies in the words response  ndrf sdrf  and mitigation  ndrmf sdrmf  mitigation is predisaster mitigation actions reduce or eliminate the loss of life and property by lessening the impact of disastersnote 2 the ndrmf sdrmf are statutory  legal  funds under the disaster management act  2005  just like the ndrf and sdrfsnote 3 the supreme court    in 2016  in an act of judicial activism    directed the creation of a national disaster mitigation fund  ndmf  and state sdmfs this was criticized a lot cause the courts got no business in the executive  working this direction was not followed by most governments in india  and has remained a nonstarter similarly  the approximately 6000 crore of revenuedeficit grants are only for state governmentssource 15th

the finance commissions websiteedit and update it seems that an inherent fact is being overlooked by people in the comments the unions devolution under the xvfcs recommendations is a constitutional obligation and was meant to happen regardless of the coronavirus epidemic it also seems that people are  rightly so  peeved at redtape because effectively the government of delhi does not get funds to combat this crisis some possible financing mechanisms that ive elaborated in the comments section are further union contributions to delhis sdrf  most effective  making funds available from the union home affairs ministry  improbable given constrained budgets  ways and means advances from rbi  30 day credit limit  union spending through new delhi municipal corporation  limited geographical spread  municipal bonds  underdeveloped and tight credit  allocations from pmnrf and pmcares donation drives from citizens and civil society i would especially like to emphasize page 99 onwards where the methodology for calculating state share of sdrmf is given some people were complaining that why kerala has been allocated so less amount compared to maharashtra there were several speculations and baseless theories  eg northsouth discrimination  but none of the critical comments  in my knowledge  mentioned about the finance commission recommendations  which is the actual reason none of them bothered to critique the recommendationsi think this post provides a good chance to the people to critique the methodology adopted by xvfc in allocation of state share of sdrmf funds people critical of distribution of funds to various states can read page 99 onwards this will help them base their criticism on actual facts  rather than their imagination you can give all the justification and due process you want we all know the real reason why delhi got 0 the short answer on why delhi didnt see a single paisa of this money is  because the fifteenth finance commission  xvfc  has not included delhi  in its recommendations this is because delhi is not a stateyes so delhi must get money then directly from centres funds right? like ndrf or the pm relief fund im sure we have lots of funds for unforseen circumstances which have funds but can be used for this emergency especially with delhi becoming an epicentre after the tablighi fiasco leave all technicalities can someone tell me how is delhi supposed to operate without this fund? basically the question is why were these alternate mechanisms not used? great post u ringtring kejriwal has been moaning about not receiving funding to combat the crisis and this is a great post explaining why delhi was not allocated fundseither kejriwal does not know the reason  mentioned in the post  or is willingly not mentioning it to create a sense of bias against aap by the centre either way  he needs to get his facts right nice research with finance commission recommendationsbut the recommendations of the fc is advisory and hence not binding on the govt  so nothing like constitutional obligations also pm cares has a lot of fund now so it can be used straight away  so i feel the ball is in central govt court now to get funds for delhi and put the end to this issue and not politicise by playing around i think kejriwal is all in his rights to ask for fundshttp  wwwarthapediain indexphp?titlefinance_commission  deleted  what

judicial activism is severely misplaced it also seems that people are  rightly so  peeved at redtape because effectively the government of delhi does not get funds to combat this crisisi wonder why the sc saw issues with how it has been setupthe job of sc is to make sure than every citizen of the union gets treated equally it is also to reign in on power excesses the executive branch is already the most powerful branch of the three and we need sc to balance the structure do we know how much of that money did they allocate to each state?", "tokenized": [101, 6768, 2038, 2025, 2042, 2445,

their education systems  focusing on economic development  building scientific among the population through proper education rather than fighting over kashmir out of which nothing was gained  it only lead to deaths of thousands of soldiers of both countries and the suffering of people in kashmirit would be so better if this onefifth population also contributed to progress of humanity and utilized

find it hard to ignore history lest they are criticized and as people more sternly start demanding peace and growth in both countries   govts will start abiding by it and move towards resolution  but anyway  the boundary question will have to be resolved other things can always be dealt with  as in indo bangladesh relations or even indo chinese relations the territory in dispute is too large  so

trying to drive up and down in one shotif you break it up into 2 night trip it will be better idea pulikat lake is quite a sight esp if the birds are in town find a decent hotel within 1hr distance along the highway town everything will be booked up esp for this launchthere is just one road leading to the site and security will stop you 56 km away  but you can take the mud road along the lake to the right of that security check point and find a good place to sitthere are hundreds of people these days who watch from that road its not crowded or anything because its a very large lake bed and you can see the launch from any point along that roadalso go post read on r isro you might find a lot more details from others  thereif its not cloudy and weather is good  a night launch is pure magic i want the answers too do we need to buy a ticket or something? heard from someone that you could buy tickets couple of months before the launch#x200b edit anybody interested like me should see this

the month ahead ramzan mubarak fellow rindiansweve been strictly instructed to follow our prayers home this year im happy  sad at this happy because those unnecessary iftar parties which has diluted the meaning of ramzan will be cancelled this year so that people can realize the true meaning of ramzan which is charity sad because masjids will be empty losing out an opportunity to socialize  meet new people about the crowds that you see glorified by godi media please understand there are bad apples from both communities may god protect us from these bad apples i dont want this to be taken in the wrong sense  just want to understand the thinking behind itwhy is it that the muslim community always looks at itself as an entity different from india they have a rebellious approach towards everything happening in the world and would at no cost sacrifice a few religious rituals during this lockdown  weve had a couple of christian and hindu festivals but both the communities held the lockdown over their celebrations but now during ramzan we see huge crowds forming up in markets and places of worship  with no masks or distancing followed i just mean to understand why this keeps happening requesting people to not turn this into an aggressive discussion i hold nothing against any community man  i remember those childhood days when we fast during the day  not even swallowing saliva  i know  there is no such rule  kids were dumb  and run back home after school and go to the mosque for foodit was the best month all year then you grow up  become an atheist  and dont fast

hospital  ill clarify a few things as to why we are having fewer cases than expected 1 we are definitely testing less than other countries 2 the real spike is yet to be seen we may still have a surge of cases too early to say that we have less cases 3 we dont know what the reson is for lower virulence in indians a newly discovered mrna in indians might be protective  as can be lower levels of ace2 there are other countries like australia as well where they have very less mortality4 we really are in no position to handle a situation like new york or lombardyedit we have confirmed reports that some hospitals are hiding positive casesedit 2  the hospital has come out with a press release admitting that they indeed have 3 positive cases however  we have known it for atleast 3 days now they hid it from the media for atleast 3 days   maybe more i have a question though  lets say india didnt have 700 but 700 000 cases in realitynot testing would result in low count  but you would still have sudden surge in people reporting to hospitals wouldnt you?  or even sudden surge in deaths related to pneumonia i just think that if numbers were as big as some are claiming them to be  like in the 200k to 500k range we wouldve definitely seen a situation where our hospitals would be overloaded and it wouldve been difficult to hide that in a country like india for those who are thinking this is not true  i would say just waitfor those who are thinking we should do more tests   i wish india had capacity for itfor those who want india should have done better  india is still a poor nation now it would be getting worsefor those who are trying to give it a religion or political angle  fk you  removed  it has been noted and stated by many that india does lack testing facilities and with the current situation with migrant workers  the situation can definitely worsen it is only a matter of time presence of mangoes on a tree ensure that its a mango tree absence of mangoes does not mean that a tree is not a mango tree  cre  bee were acquiring herd immunity yall for once  i am feeling proud for our governments timely step i was thinking that we might be testing less than required but today i came across this article which gave a bit of solace  https  wwwindiaspendcom 1in50covid19testsinindiaarecomingoutpositivecomparedwith1in4initaly1in10intheuk they discuss the ratio of confirmed cases to total number of tests quoting from the articleindia tested 25 254 samples as of 8 pm on march 25  of which 581  23  were positive  according to the latest update from the indian council of medical research this proportion is comparable with south koreas  3  and higher than taiwans  1 in comparison  74 386 of 324 445 tests  23  in italy  6 001 of 35 995 tests  167  in austria  65 497 of 484 062 tests  135  in the us and 9 529 of 97 019 tests  10  in the uk were positivemore targeted testing in other countries could also be a reason for their higher percentages  removed  just being a negative nancy is she  pj lets not forget we indians dont like going to docters and prefer selfmedication pretty sure many people especially in age 2040 sitting home with virus keeping the mortality rate at 1  i would state that the real number is affected cases at the max could be 2 000 from the current near 1000 so were off by a factor of 2 death rate is more reliable than number of cases  for countries with democracy  death toll in india is currently 20 since its in initial stage in india  we can take mortality rate of 2 now after calculating we get roughly 1000 cases which is in line with currently 902 cases you can add 100 to 200 in 1000 cases but not more than that i believe that government is actively working on this problem  major decisions regarding converting schools in hospitals  railway coach into quarantine center  developing new methods of testing etcso we as indian need to contribute to the efforts of government in any way and manner we can just like rape in saudi arabia no report  no rapeno test  no coronago corona think about bangladesh then they are even more crowded than us i believe they are one of the most densely populated countries in the world havent heard much about covid from them though so india has 25 of hit rate on the testswhile other countries have 10and india has been denying tests to most who show uphow do we explain this? keyword may day 1 50 infected  day 2  those 50 infected 500 more   edit  r0 is not a constant 10 permanently  is an example  the numbers can vary based on precautions taken and communities may have higher or lower rates of spread and it may also mean r0 can rise day by day  or go down day by day please refer to the statistical data and feel free to calculate again if my example doesnt satisfy you reasoning behind using r0  10   the inadequate tests and spread rates that are partially evident  66 as mild symptoms  conservative side of 80 as on some sites once again kept r0 as 0  considering it is not contained and during incubation period one person can easily come in contact with atleast 1015 also there is an error it wont be day 2 for 500  day 2  incubation period started so should be day 4 or day 5 to get to 500 resulting in a possible 12 day delay in actual show of 50 to 500 6 days to spread  and 8 days for the spreaded to be in turn infected again i may have accidentally skipped any info please let me know in comments breakdown of those 500    66  300  show mild symptoms and their immunity kicks in and a fraction of them recover without even consulting a doctor  recovery period about 1 week with 1 week incubation period  aka 2 weeks of being a potential spreader   while some of them do get a few symptoms a fraction practises quarantine and some meds and gets better  never realizing they were infected with covid 19  most of this group     33  200  which will show symptoms and get worse progressively and more likely visit hospitals  even a small fraction of this will not get self treated and may recover or some may die  post mortem will they be classified as covid 19 death ? now the reports which we do know are covid 19 are an actual subset of this 200 people group  which will show up on radar approx 4 days after day 2  aka on day 6  due to eventually finding out  we also miss on a good chunk of the carriers who will not be tested and will add easily to the exponential growth  all the while the actual cases which are severe will be followed with a 45 day delay  which is enough to track down for maybe 50 cases but for 500 carriers not possible in absence of widespread testing  this can be visualized mathematically  easily remember to factor in the methods of verification of a positive case from the 10 actual infected  the carriers are least likely to be tested or quarantined also considering weather changes and other factors many of this symptoms  a common citizen  may  think of as weather change issue and not some corona virus infection that is taking root so true thats why kerala shows more cases as they check vigilantly", "tokenized": [101, 9871, 8519, 1999, 2019, 25933, 2006, 2659, 4175, 1997, 2522, 17258, 16147, 3572, 1999, 2634, 2004,

department of my college just confessed that our final exams are evaluated randomly  and in less than 2 minutes per answer sheet how can we get this to some news outlet?nonpoliticalim posting this the third time because  r india doesnt allow quora links you can find the source by copy pasting some text from below and googling i am going to write the truth about this unfair evaluationthere are few things u must know  1 ggsipu pays rs 25 per answer book in one bundle there are 30 answer books so it makes rs750   for evaluating one bundleggsipu norms say that a evaluator must take 3 hours to evaluate one bundleso in a day a evaluator can evaluate a maximum of two bundleswhich makes a total earning of rs1500  per day + a conveance of rs600  per day making the total amount  rs 2100  now what actually happens is in the university there are two evaluation centres one for first and third year and the other for second and final yearnow actually what happens isan evaluator reaches centre a at 930 am and get a bundle issued which he she checks in one hour but do not deposit it as the university employees will not take it back before three hoursso they leave that bundle there and rush too the b centre and get another bundle issued there at 1100  they check it by 1200 now they rush back to centre a to return their previous bundle and get a new bundle issued therethe same process is repeated and an evaluator ends up in checking two bundles each at both evaluation centres thus earning rs 4200  a day instead of rs 2100   a day now just imagine the answer book u wrote in 3 hours is evaluated in less then 2 minutescoz the evaluator has to right the marks on front sheet and do the total and also fill an additional evaluation sheet with marksand all this he does in a maximum of 1 and a half hour for 30 answer books this is done by around 20  evaluators who comes for evaluation  2 to be an evaluator the university ask every evaluator to fill a form which contains a maximum of four subject that the evaluator has taught in the current semesterthis form need to be signed by the hod and the head of the institution alsonow the beauty is very few teachers teaches more then two subject in college but in these forms most of the evaluators fill four subjectsnow imagine four subject for centre a and four subject for centre b which mean they know 8 subjects and thus makes them elligible to check copies of 8 different subjectscoz if one subject answer books are over then they can get the next subject issued  3 approx 80  of the evaluators do not prepare a solution nor do they know the solutionthey are just giving average marksthat is the reason why the students writing anything get marks and often pass the exams  4 most of the senior and sincere teachers do not go for evaluationthe people doing evaluation are primarily those who are on consolidated salary getting anything between rs20 000  to rs 30 000  as salary from there parent collegeso they find it as an opportunity to earn some extra moneyjust imagine that there are evaluators who earn around rs 50 000  or even more during evaluationthis should explain most of the reasons  5 the fact is very few evaluators actually evaluate the answer books90 of evaluation is done with just the monitary benefits associated with itso until the university takes some serious counter measures this will continue to happen  i am sorry for those who feel offended by my answerbut am ready to face any debate who could challenge my answer  mukesh sahu assistant professor  ece deptt  hod  industry institute

trust me happens here to   university of madras and anna universityanna university is the worst of the lot  i have seen my friends getting a s grade after applying for revaluationin the end they pay 750rs per paper original exam fese  + 700rs revaluation fess  any inside stories from vtu? eh? isnt this common knowledge? in ap  telangana both 10th 11th and 12th papers are corrected by lecturers coming from schools and other districts and they are paid according to number of answer scripts they check like 8rs per paper so  to make money  they end up rushing even ou and jntu engineering papers are corrected this way also  since they come from other districts  if you give latest relevant examples on your answers  theyll cut marks since that example is different from your text book subjective exams in india   ah the good old days in my medical sciences university  we enacted wide ranging examination reforms we tried to make all our examinations objective  see osce   ospe   however  the medical council of india had mandated essay and short answer type questions and we could only impose objectivised examinations for the formative stage for summative however  we did thisone evaluator will evaluate one answer for all the students who appeared in the exam his bias will be distributed equally to all the students also  we do postexamination analysis to see if the answermarks form a bell curve camel humps and shifts to right and left will make us blacklist the examiner in post graduate exams  the same answersheet is evaluated independently by three examiners  blinded to others marks if the discrepancy between the three is greater than 25  a fourth examiner is bought in and the average of all the four is taken as marks awardedit is possible to study the problem and introduce corrective steps  but most of our universities are archaic and very slow to change anything  it happened to me in my first semester at college of engineering guindy  chennai   the lecturer was miffed with our batch and decided to fail random students   she awarded f for first  middle and last 6 of students with even roll numbers     i fell in one of those even roll number and failed  despite having scored s grade in all my internals  and it was my favourite paper   failing first time academically was hard on me  and i was crying in my lecture hall for the whole day  cringe    i had to apply for reevaluation to clear it      that episode was a turning point in my student life  and went on to score few more arrears in the following semesters  and didnt give a flying fuck        our

taxes for his corporate buddies the resulting  tax reduction  of around 27   https  wwwnationalheraldindiacom national corporatetaxcutsapanicreactiontotideoverchoppysensexcongress  means government will lose around 145 lakh crore in tax revenue now  remember that the government had forced rbi to give it 175 lakh crore to boost the economy?  so effectively  government tax cut will cause a loss of 145 lakh crore  and rbi money will be used to make up for it in effect  modi kaka is using our money so that corporates can get richer and share their wealth with him so that he can continue to dress

up themselves  by buying their own stocks or giving bigger bonuses  op points that the real problem currently is that people are not buying anything less demands mean business have to reduce production as people are buying less reducing production means some workers have less or no work to do so businesses will reduce the work force some businesses will reduce salary of workforce net effect  there will be less and less money to buy things reduced demands means more business loss and job cuts op suggests an income tax rate cut would help with this if people have more money in hand  they will invest and spend more an income tax rate cut is one way to ensure salaried people have more money the centre of the governments policy in dealing with the economic slowdown has been to offer

benefits to the wealthy trickle down to everyone else these benefits are usually tax cuts on businesses  highincome earners  capital gains  and dividends the theory says that only rich people can drive economic growth so it proposes tax cuts only for the wealthy  and not a general tax cut for everyone it also proposes that the cuts have to be big for it to work  based on  laffer curve  https  wwwinvestopediacom terms l laffercurveasp  theory  it promises that the wealthy will use the extra money from the tax cuts to invest more  and expand business this in turn will create more jobs or better jobs  higher salary  thus  new jobs or higher salary mean people will spend more money and thus boost the economy  this was applied by reagan and bush in the usa during both the reagan and bush era  the economy improved but reagan had also increased government spending bush had also lowered federal fund rates  so loans became cheaper  so critics do not accept that the trickle down tax cut theory helped the economy  they point out that during both reagan and bush era  inequality between the wealthy and the poor increased the top onefifth of the rich increased their income by 80 the top 1 percent tripled their income so instead of trickling down  the wealthy just became wealthier privatisation of profit and socialisation of loss bhai  simple chutiya people deserve chutiyi goverment

bjp tatti bhi laake denge toh log kahega wah ye toh amrit hai bjp is comparing this to 1991 economic reforms we live in a time when subsidies and loan waiver to poor is considered freebies and doling out money to corporates is considered essential for boosting business the underlying logics are just bizarre govt dont understand the meaning of reserve in rbi these  govt  are the kind of people who would tell you they cant hear you because its dark outside well op  you dont really understand or have never run a business see  we have 10 lakh people coming in the cities looking for jobs every month this is from agricultural displacement + new entrants in the workforcewe fill about 5 of thatnow  we are surrounded by countries like indonesia  vietnam  bangladesh  thailand and malaysia each of them is growing yoy in manufacturing exports  women participation in workforce and gdp per capita faster than indiaalso  there is a unique situation in world trade where companies are looking to hedge their investments made in china due to a possible breakdown in trade relations with the us and chinaany company who has to invest anywhere makes an excel sheet to check probable rois and compares it with their options we had 35 taxes while every single one of these countries had 2025op thinks because there is no demand for consumption  thats why there is a slowdown but how does demand arise? do you want the government to magically gift people money? people need to work to earn and save money money for a poor country like us comes in the form of wages and salaries from manufacturing they do not come through subsidies that road leads to venezuelathis move is not about buybacks or dividends they are still taxed  unfairly  this move is about increasing the base 15 tax for new manufacturing units goes a long  long way it has never been done in india before and it needs to be applauded we dont even export as many clothes as fucking bangaldesh what the fuck are you talking about?we are not rich we are poor we need capital lots of it the us has zero  capital gains tax for foreign investors this after being the largest gdp country in the world compare our attitude when pranab mukherjee made a retrospective amendment to tax one single company after losing a case in the highest court of the country lucid op is lucidi disagree on reducing income tax as being workable in india however not enough people pay income tax or are eligible to do so doubt a reduction would make any difference since it would affect just a percentage of the middle class at this point most people earn below 25lpathe demand side issue at a larger level is not driven by taxation alone but  probably  low wages  toomanybills  debt  stagnating rural incomein my view  direct cash transfer using jam shouldve been done this aint a bizzare world  it is just late stage capitalism yeh govermint to tatti bhi prasad samajh ke khilwaayegi peoples brains have been rotted inside out by the same brainworms that affect american conservatives even if you discount the clear chain of shitty budgeting between rbi and the tax cut  what reason could possibly drive salaried workers to cheer for corporate tax cuts? they would have to be insanely gullible or incredibly misinformed to believe the moneys coming back to their pocketsim going to sound like a tinfoil lunatic when i say this  but the sheer prevalence of the procapitalist promarket narrative in india makes me think that thinktanks like orf and brookings are actively churning it out in ways that arent quite visible to me  yet  is modi our reagan? fuck people are going to be unhappy regardless  so why give a fuck bhai  in simple words you are wrong in your understandingthere are hundreds of up points of reducing corporate tax  at par with asian countries im celebrating it  but for a very different reason as i understand it  its not going to improve the governments wealth thats a good thing in my eyes  because lack of funds will keep a check on their madcap hindutva social misadventures like nrc was confused since a month wether it is a slowdown or a recession the corporate tax cut just tilted it towards a recession time to cash out and run for the hills hour will kaka get foreign funding for his party otherwise? someone has to pay fucking idiots the bunch of them and all you morons that celebrate thisnone bigger than youthese tax cuts were promised for agesthey will not only help ease the burden of the companies but theyll also aid demand owing to lower prices when the benefits are passed ondont rant just for the sake it  nobody is giving the corporates any money  they are just paying less which is good because the consumer then will pay less dont forgot the 1 billion in aid to russia corporate tax cuts are a necessary step to improve the economy  but its not the only step this is widely backed by evidence i would like to believe evidence based policies rather than mindless opposition or support  whatever may be the party", "tokenized": [101, 1996, 22410, 3138, 12862, 2474, 10023, 21665, 2013, 1996, 16929, 1998, 10951, 2000, 2507, 13741, 2474, 10023, 21665, 2000, 2312,

software engineer for over a decade and a half  and now i am part of the alt news team that is trying to work on the issue of misinformation disinformation in india on twitter  i can be followed at  free_thinker  and alt news can be followed at  altnewsplease feel free to ask me questions about the issue of misinfo disinfo  about alt news  about what the social media platforms are doing  and more how does one join your team fulltime and parttime? what type of roles do you have? do you like to eat mangoes? whats your business model? in how many ways do you generate revenue? i suggest everyone listen to the episode fighting fake news in the seen and unseen podcast with amit verma i watched it and learnt a lot about you i want to thank you for the brilliant work you are doing such work requires a lot of personal sacrifices and im sure there are lacs who appreciate iti have only one questionwhat do you see as altnews biggest threat today? how can the average indian help you combat this? can you guys develop something like a browser extension which can automatically alert about a fake news page when visited for example  anti virus software indicate weather a web page has malicious links etc  removed  do you ever get threat calls by political parties for exposing fake news? you are doing all your work from ahmedabad how do you do verification of information in other cities when someone has to go physically to a place im sure many of us would be ready to volunteer our services in these cases do you keep records of who shares the most amount of fake news on twitter? would love to see a chart listing the top 25 fake news tweeters in india and share it on whatsapp in all my groups i have a feeling that m kishwar will top the charts if one is prepared pratik  do you believe in religion concept of an omnipotent higher power? hi pratik been a follower since alt news inception great work  big fani just wonder why alt news is not getting much popularity that it deserves hire a pr agency may be?thanks have you ever made a mistake? like not checking a fact or news properly and mislabeling it as false? how did you correct it? do you think social media platforms should remove content which fact checkers have deemed false? if yes  doesnt that put a lot of power in the hands of the factcheckers  who can then easily suppress opinions contrary to theirs? in essence  the question is who checks the factcheckers if no  what can we do to reduce fake news on social media  without taking away peoples right to free speech? yesterday i had a big argument on twitter less surprising  eh?  that altnews shows a bias on one side only  but i countered by saying most of the fake news is generated to favour one side of the table how would pratik convince people on that side that altnews is absolutely neutral and brutal when it comes to quashing misinformation disinformation? i want to contribute to altnews  but live outside india the funding page  via instamojo only accepts payment methods from india how else can i donate? how do you guys first determine that one piece of information might be fake?when determined how do you guys investigate the information further?is there one particular thing which is false but its belived to be true by majority which have amused you guys? can you tell us if during this current government the number of fake news against muslims has increased in the recent years or not? and if yes how could we tackle it heremy next question is  is there a troll army who sends islamophobic whastapp and twitter messages daily on behalf of bjp to make their front strong?editand you people are doing a good job for humanity profit or not the service you are doing with credibility you people have made in recent years is worth praise aapka aur zubair bhai ka bahot bahot dil se shukriya dhanyawad hi pratik     do you think checking whether a news article is fake can be automated in the near future  so that there can be a mobile app that moreorless does the job ? do you think the prevalence of fake news articles that we are seeing  which is being used by interested parties to shape their narrative  is the new normal in the political scenario from now on? if yes  is there a sustainable way to fight it? are you hopeful that our current liberal constitution will ultimately prevail over the fascist theocratic ideologies contesting it? in the age of post truth  busting fake informations are still worth it for the people?i havent see yet   any politicians or any celebrities apologize or regret for spreading fake newshow do you defend yourself from allegations that you are more anti bjp? hi pratik  i am just curious have you teamed with social media platforms to provide this as a service   also have they incorporated your tool within their platform?", "tokenized": [101, 7632, 2417, 23194, 1045, 2572, 10975, 10450, 2243, 8254, 3270, 2522, 14876, 20824, 1997, 12456, 2739, 3198, 2033, 2505,

unique experienceseriously  there is no dearth of weird shit that can happen i went to watch joker in an afternoon show and here is a list of things that happened1 some guys came with heath ledger type facepaint and saste ka clown masks they were denied entry because they didnt have id to prove they were above 18 this bunch of joker anarchists was then seen begging the security to let them in2 i overheard a guy was telling his girlfriend that heath ledger would make a cameo in this movie i thought he was pranking her but he seemed to be convinced3 another group of people  who i had the unfortunate experience of sitting next to later  were chanting anarchy slogans as they entered the theater they were asked to shut up by the ushers these same bunch proceeded to take videos and photos of iconic clips from the movie  sometimes with their flash on thankfully they were thrown out4 someones family member apparently died hospitalized in the climax of the movie and he began crying loudly while on the call he ran out after a few seconds but some people who were next to him were genuinely confused about whether to ask him to shut up or not5 i spotted a celebrity photographer in the theater watching the movie with his wife i used to love his early work and it sort of inspired me into getting into amateur photography i was contemplating throughout the movie what i will say to him or will he be cool to take a picture with me etc i had them locked on while they were exiting and ended up standing right next to them in the dark exit hallway walking out as i was about to talk to him  he and his wife started having an argument i just continued walking past them and left thanks to the awkwardnessthoughts about the movie? its great just try going for a show where you can avoid the college crowd dunno why these people worship the joker we live in a society is the photographer auditya of audi photography by any chance ? i remember watching the dark knight in theater  it was mostly empty and my friends were kinda making fun of me for watching comic book movie from that to heath ledger face painted joker anarchists  i am kinda glad   sounds like a fun night aur ek main hun jo war chala gayasorry dosto joker ke english subtitles nahi they  apun partially deaf hai  deleted  is the film cursed or what everyone going there is having troubles nah nah i think the cinema is cursedor maybe op is  considering this many unfortunaties happening in one go  removed  holy shit all of those in a single show? where is this? hahaha heres what i experienced yesterday watching the movie1  dude in front of me got a huge popcorn bucket and well  he annoyed me throughout the movie2  in this brooding serious movie  bunch of guys and girls howled  whistled and clapped when arthur fleck finally got the joker makeup  and then when he got the bloody smile i felt like i was watching a sallu bhai movie3  girl behind said after the movie ended  dc waale bahut weird movie hi banate hai no 3 i hate it when people start making videos of movie to upload to their insta status   no one fkin cares what movie you are watching unless its mia khalifas comeback video playing in imax no 4 it can legit happen to anyone anywhere in the world but people need to learn the courtesy of going out before taking calls or put the frikkin thing on silent and enjoy the movie i bet  r bollywood might also like this whenever i go to watch a cgifest at the multiplex  i keep hearing audience on the way extolling how christopher nolan is the greatest film director ever basic human empathy tells you not to say shut up to someone who is clearly going through sudden emotional trauma imagine yourself in his shoes other than that  haha dunno why these people worship the jokerits the kind of people who dont get the message from the movie its not just joker though  although he is definitely the biggest idol for the incel culture on the internet these people also think rorschach  tyler durden  travis bickle etc were the good guys in their movies what the fuck but you know what  ive watched movies in some shadyass neighborhoods of north america and some of this applies to those

government and corporates for an upgrade  global rating agency fitch ratings has kept its sovereign rating on india unchanged  citing weak public finances in its latest rating review  fitch acknowledged indias strong growth and recent economic reforms but maintained that the state of the governments finances do not justify an upgrade fitch affirmed indias sovereign rating at bbb  the lowest investment grade rating the outlook on indias rating remains stable  with the agency saying that upside and downside risks to the sovereign rating are broadly balancedindias longterm foreign and localcurrency issuer default ratings were also at bbb indias sovereign ratings balance a strong mediumterm growth outlook and favourable external balances with a weak fiscal position and difficult business environment however  the business environment is likely to gradually improve with the implementation and continued broadening of the governments structural reform agenda  it said on monday  hdfc chairman deepak parekh had said  why is india  the fastest growing emerging economy for over one year now with all macroeconomic fundamentals being positive  rated just bbb? on the other hand  italy and spain  which are far weaker and smaller  are having much higher ratings than usitalian banks are in far worse shape than our banks italian government is more shaky and we have a solid

per cent  and wide fiscal balance of 66 per cent of gdp as estimated by fitch for fy17 however  there are some early indications that fiscal policy might become more focussed on bringing down debt  it saidfitch said indias economy is less developed on a number of structural metrics than many of its peers average per capita gdp remains low at 1 714  compared with the bbb range median of 9 701 governance standards also remain weak  as illustrated by a low score for the world bank governance indicator  46th percentile versus the bbb median of 58th percentile an official committee reviewing the fiscal responsibility and budget management act has recommended lowering government debt to 60 per cent of gdp it remains uncertain if the government will commit to the target suggested by the committee  but in his february 2017 budget speech  the finance minister explicitly recognised the low number of direct taxpayers  stating that india is largely a tax noncompliant society  which is a significant change in rhetoric the central governments fy18 budget also continues its gradual consolidation efforts irrespective of the difficult tradeoff with the desire to spur infrastructure spending  fitch saidsignificant contingent liabilities for the sovereign continue to emanate from public sector banks the banking sectors nonperforming assets  npas  problem is well recognised by authorities  but continues to linger  it said fitch expects npas to rise to 97 per cent of total loans by endfy17  from 46 per cent in fy15  due mainly to stricter implementation of standardsfor all

diamond jewelry export company  owned by an indianamerican  i am working in the jewelry company for the past two years but since i am the youngest i am given odd works i am being paid 55 000 baht per month  after tax  i was wondering what my options for a secure future are? i am starting to get complacent in my job  getting comfortable with my monthly salary which i do not want if i get fired or if i want to switch my job  i do not feel i have enough skills to get an equivalent salary another issue is that the jewelry industry is shrinking i am also not sure if i enjoy the industry as much i have a few options in mind but opinions are needed my options are 1 cfa2 mba3 starting a businessi am so confused in life about my career that i hate even thinking about it my work timings are 830 am

to go to the western countries or india  wouldnt do it in thailand i do not mind shifting back to india if required my family is not very well off my parents do not have a lot of money save for their retirement if you have the cover of a reasonably relaxed job  use the time and space to acquire skills which are valuable in the market then use those to change   upgrade jobs i leave it to you to decide what skills to acquire  too hard to give specific advice on the internet without knowing you   your circumstances in personlook for a confluence of personal interest  in acquiring a skill  and that  skill having high market value  people will pay you money for that skill good luck having a business is always the ideal solution but it is also very risky  plus you need to have a good idea that works and it will take a lot of energy and effort to even get it goingmoving to the west is almost always a good idea if you are qualified enough as they provide better opportunities  pay and

boyfriend is from india and i am americanhes told me that in india  its rude to refuse food  and that hosts will often push you to eat more than you might otherwise need wantthe problem is that i am recovering from an eating disorder and its really important for me that i listen to my fullness cues otherwise im super prone to relapse its also troubling because many members of his family are overweight and i am really nervous at the thought of visiting them and being pressured to eat more than i am comfortable withi want to enjoy my time and also not feel pressured to overeat  while not coming across as rudehow can i politely refuse food if i am full? is it really as impossible to do so politely as my boyfriend has made it seem? thanks aaj mera upwas hainjust learn this phrase feel free to refuse a lot of indians dont understand boundaries and therefore its upto you to have one  its a little frustrating  to be honest i understand what youre trying to express  i used to be in a similar state by being an overeater emotional overeater especially when my mom or aunts would pour in more food in my plate than required you could do a couple things depending on how close you are with them1 you could express yourself  and open yourself to them  so they wouldnt push you any further 2 pretend to be full before you actually are  so when they do stuff your plate with more foods  you dont feel sick or 3 as soon as youre done  you run to the kitchen to leave your plate  wouldnt really just that  but the idea was somewhat funny hope it helps besides  if they care for you   as we try to show our affection by feeding others   theyd understand what youre going through and wouldnt be offended hope this helps tell them you are allergic to  carbs and vegetable oil big chunk of options  will be taken off the shelf  one trick that works for me is say you are full well before you are they will push to eat some more  refuse it a couple of times and then have it   things not to do in lifevisit india when you are recovering from an eating disordernone of the advice people giving you on this sub will work when you are gonna see so much delicious stuff and you would want to try each and every one of those  how can i politely refuse food if i am full? you start saying im full when you have eaten 50 of what you want to eat just say ewww at hit the hand holding the plate  s just say that you are stuffed and mentioned that you loved it usually works i dont smoke so whenever somebody offers or forces me a cigarette  i say i just had one before coming here haha simple and short stay drama free put your foot down and say no  thank youstay drama free and simple repeatsay no  thank you arre nahi aunty pet bhar gaya aur nahi kha sakhti sach main aunty pet full ho gaya isse teen chaar bar bol dijye tell them you or on a fast simple as that  just ask for a glass of water when they offer foodit works out for me just say pehle aap lijiye just say that you had a very late previous meal for eg  if youre invited over dinner  tell them that you had a very late lunch nahi chahiye ji any karl rock fans up in this bitch?", "tokenized": [101, 2129, 2079, 1045, 16954, 2735,

thing as an anonymous complaint in india  they can easily find your name dude inform the cwc ie child welfare commission and ask them to get case filed under s 75 of the juvenile justice act twitter

with me hi i am a 20 year old i am very interested in photography and i would like to engage more systematically in it i am a beginneri would like to invest in a good dslr camera as i dont own one yet someone who could guide me on that and also take me through things on beginning in this field i would like to intern under someone as an assistant so i can get exposed to the on field working and learn practicallyi am passionate about capturing anything evoking an emotion i believe myself to have an eye for detail and an active observer of everyday little things i like to document them as of now i have just tried my hand in phone photography and uploaded pictures on my instagram the photos i click are sometimes personal to what i relate to and often open to interpretationthank you for reading please help me out dont know where you are from  sorry  but this field is really  really overbookedfor me  a single photographer has no future in india  my best advice will be  make a team and join an elder internship will be more than free when actual photography already charges very low feesi know because i tried myself in bangalore and most of the people do shooting for free to build their portfolio so most of customers expects very low budget with best gear so it takes years to refund materialsdoesnt make sense #x200b second and last advice  be the best at postproduct  lr and ps  take this question to  jjmpf  http  wwwjjmehtacom forum indexphp  as well too many people interested in photography especially those in collegeso your best bet is to take some good photographs which

peoplei posted this in r indian_academia but didnt get any responses posting here for better visibility sorry for a long post but i would really appreciate some career guidanceim gonna give you a brief background of my situation i graduated in 2016 with a bsc in statistics  mathematics and economics  from christ university bangalore if it matters  during second year of college i really got into skateboarding and was desperately trying to make it work as a career option i worked with holystoked collective  they are the pioneers of skateboarding scene in india   built a skatepark in bangalore with them and life was amazing but towards the end of my undergrad i injured my knee pretty bad and things went downhill from there one injury led to another and before i could realize  i had a knee issue  back pain  hip pain and what not i was in poor health and it eventually took toll on my mental health long story short i pretty much wasted a little over one year in 2017 i got my shit together and wrote the entrance test for writing actuarial exams i started writing actuarial exams in 2018 and cleared 4 core technical exams by the end of 2019 i was going to write two more exams this april but our exams got cancelled due to covid 19 pandemicnow  ive been looking for an actuarial job for some time now and realized that its really really hard to get a job without contacts or college placements i have also been learning data sciece and machine learning with python  as i already have a solid maths and statistics foundation  so as to get a data science or data analyst job and then perhaps switch to actuarial eventually but now with an almost inevitable economic recession looming over our heads  im a little worried about my careercould someone please guide me? where do i go from here? should i keep looking for jobs? even if i do find a job i dont expect it to be more than 5lpa or should i go for higher education? would an mba in finance or business analytics make sense? i said you  do not test waters again and again specially at the time of your career start i did this and almost wasted my 2 years and still dont know where to go forward to  i did my mba in 2017 in marketing and it field then i was doing job as a business development executive for around 6 month  i dont know what but after that i fight for ssc for hard 2 years but i just appeared for once in that exam as the other one got postponed back in 2018now  i totally dropped that idea but meanwhile ssc prepration i do some freelance marketing pipeline models for businesses and small firms i did advertisement assesment job in between on contract i was also a ca ipcc dropped out as i can still do articleship but i didnt want to go to that domain now now  i planned to do data analyst and data science role as ive pretty good amount of business  commerce  finance  mathematics knowledge with keen intrest on technology and im pretty good in it also with dbms so  now i wanted to learn python then data science or analyst with some ml and ai on hand but luckily covid 19 hits and all my savings for 6 months is going out slowly in 2020 im going to be a programmer of python for sure long para short  its better to stick to one thing for long  yep sometimes its hard to figure out which is going to be good but i learner that its not good to be a perfectionist in each case if the salary starts at 5l  ill go for it money is not a concern in life it should be the skills you have in hand and the knowledge  experience you have throughout your journeyinterviews mostly based on reference  top college degrees  confidence  skills you must have atleast 2 to get through any job interview i was an adventurer like youthen i took an arrow to the knees", "tokenized": [101, 2552,

bad personally  i like it well enough i think its something of a selffulfilling prophecy where youre told it tastes disgusting in childhood  because of its reputation as poorpeople food  sickpeople food and  well  horse feed  and that ends up influencing your experience similar to broccoli in the west i had to google what horse gram is never heard of it in my life i know exactly what hes talking

out of the loop as per the procedure now home ministry is one of the most important in current condition   but amit shah who can confidently take press conferences unlike his guru is seen nowherewas having a chat with a old friend who is a gujrat based journalist  he was saying that modi dreams have got bigger and he is now aiming to become somewhat of a global icon and dreaming of a nobel prize like obama   the reason we see him buttering international leaders like trump and jinpingmodi is also video conferencing other chief ministers and taking stock of this pandemic albeit in a very democratic mannerfew months back  he has instructed party top brass to keep hindumuslim politics aside as he will go for a image rebuilding in the coming yearsbut shah is shah  his entire political career is based on communal politics  and he is quite dope on that and cannot survive if he doesnt do his regular drama we can see the notorius up police filing firs on news channels on false reporting of tabliki jamaat attendees   it was an outcome of modi giving a stern warning to party top brass to not give a communal twist to corona pandemic congress has a godfather culture  where party leaders usually dont topple their godfatherbut bjp is quite opposite where there is a culture of outsmarting their gurus  be it modiadvani  gadkarifadnavis  shivrajvijayvargiya  maybe amit shah was also planning the same and was getting bigger for his shoes  hence his wings are getting clipped  i find two points not fitting well the reason we see him buttering international leaders like trump and jinpinglol  us and china didnt have anything to do with nobel prize  trump couldnt win himself and china imprisoned a winner for exposing ccp https  timecom 5746538 nobelpeaceprizeevolution modi is also video conferencing other chief ministers and taking stock of this pandemic albeit in a very democratic mannerhealth is a state subject  center can announce lockdown but workers on the  ground  belongs to states  center has zero control over them unless they declare emergency   as the resources and controls are shared    ie railways   fci  airways   interstate road transportation   health workers  police  they all need to work together so   there has to be coordination meetings well rest is  your  observation  you are free to express well could bebut modi is a very good actor been hearing this theory on alot of independent news sources since the past week  however  you can never trust reptilians lol   as someone who has been living in guj for 30 years  this is a baseless theory hes fat and has diabetes probably he has to stay hidden great story few months back  he has instructed party top brass to keep hindumuslim politics aside as he will go for a image rebuilding in the coming yearsfew months back we were seeing a united india protesting against caa  which was reduced down to a hindu muslim issue in the name of shaheen baghthis could be fanfic for all we know the rule of two  the apprentice will become the new master the force is strong in the dark side now its time to embrace the dark side shah will be the new emperor i was talking to someone who is close to the thackerays a few months ago and this is what he told me before the maharashtra elections  there was a clear verbal agreement between the ss and the bjp that power would be shared  and ss would choose its own representative to be the cm for the first 25 years this was hammered out between amit shah and ut however  fadnavis was not part of this discussion fadnavis was known as a narendra modi acolyte who often bypassed amit shah his slogan internally during the elections was dilli mein narendra  yahan pe devendra after the elections  he was triumphantly setting himself up for a second term  when the ss pulled the rug under him  reminding the bjp of the agreement with amit shah then all hell broke loose  and that is how we have a ssncpcongress government in maharashtra amit shah sat back and watched as fadnaviss wings were clipped reported for bullshit this sounds absolute nonsense to me coz communal politics is going as strong as ever and why is it only up police  why not other bjp states too?  deleted  d you do paint the bjp as siths man there are always two i didnt see a cow in this table where is the cow? seems plausible every megalomaniac thinks his subordinates are replaceable trump will not doubt will this coming election that too without any second in command of shah stature to modi  trumps mo of power wielding probably seems like heaven  surround yourself with nincompoops and do whatever you want because the public loves you yes  it makes total senseprobably why theres so much conflict between shah and doval both are doers but one is a no name government employee and the other is a well known and dangerous goon modi prefers people that do not have any personal political standingbut i dont quite believe it not just yet modi will still run to shah come up elections tf is this blinds and gossip bullshit amit shah was there in cabinet meetings saw atleast 34 photos of different meetings hes probably taking a break from being at forefront perhaps shah took responsibility for delhi wipeout and retreated into the shadows  s i hope  maybe even after a lot of years later  we get to watch a movie read a book with the actual dirt that went on inside bjps office during these years who do you guys think would write that book? provide the source please i think its not his thing shah will surface again when the time come but dont think modi is different than shah dont look at what someone says look at what they does remember kapdo se he pahchan me aa jata hai? before saying stop communalizig corona they let full 1015 days communal poison spread their purpose is fulfilled now they are just waiting this this to end and than theyll start doing it again remember ayodya verdict? every was told sab court ka nirday manenge and they had already bought the judges meanwhile these are some real samples of pure evil people working together they arent going to change their politics overnight they have been doing this all their life this

economic and social issues  but am strongly liberal and progressive on civil liberties if someone labels me leftist  i would say  not entirely true  but sometimes im pretty leftist with being labeled socialist  i would disagree more assertively  citing my strong inclinations towards a healthy mixed economy and market driven solutions to socioeconomic problems but if i was to be labeled communist or naxalite  i would vehemently disagree im sure there are some overlaps between these ideologies and mine  but that way ill have some overlaps with almost all ideologies in the world so theres a spectrum on the left side of politics  which is well understood widely like me  most leftists dont identify with being communist or naxalitenow  right of centre politics  which is having a bit of a peak moment globally at the moment  is bound to have similar diversity and differentiation but this differentiation is not as well understood  perhaps because indian right has not been as dominant historically as it has been lately  so people havent caught up yet in case of the modishah government  a lot of people voted for them in the 2014 general elections because of the anticorruption and development narrative they campaigned with  and because of the national security issue which peaked following pulwama attack and balakot airstrikes these people may be supporters of marketdriven economic reforms  may want a break from the status quo of structural corruption in the indian state  may aspire towards a more assertive foreign policy and may desire a more proactive law and order regime these are issues which many pragmatic liberals and leftists would also support i  myself support many of this governments foreign  security and environmental policies cant say the same for this governments economic policies and civil liberties record anyone who doesnt see the plight of the indian economy is delusionalcoming back to the topic  most of the bjp voters may not support the rss agenda or consider modi an avatar of vishnu but nonetheless  in the everyday online discourse  anyone supporting modi or governments policy is labeled as modicultist  b word  or belonging to rss  s word  these terms have been misused so much that they have become meaningless  but at least  they are not as obscene as the terms that the right uses against left  this distinction between moderates and extremists on the right needs to be acknowledged and understood the extremists on the indian right subscribe to the savarkarite ideology of radical majoritarian nationalism  which they try to link with hinduism  by calling it hindutva the extremist savarkarites are the ones who indulge in conspiracy theories of global islamic takeover  and that sab mile hue hain  students  congress  aap  muslims  bollywood  global media  even pak and dawood  they act as if questioning our own government in a democracy is a crime these savarkarites are violently antigandhian  so they are ready to justify any means  as long as the ends are as per their ideology they are ok with democratic institutions being destroyed so that their leader wins   hundreds dying because of demonetisation  regular kashmiris suffering because of some extremist elements  innocent students being shot at because of vandalism done by others  and so onthis extremist faction of the right is the real danger to our nation  and to whom most liberal leftists are strongly opposed these savarkarites interpret the bjp manadate to mean that majority of the country supports their extremists views of establishment of hindu rashtra  demonization of muslims and oneparty state in india they forget that 65  of indians didnt vote for bjp  and even among the 35 that did   many dont support their extremist agenda these spontaneous  peaceful protests by lakhs of students in every single part of the country has proven that these savarkarites are delusional india is strongly pluralistic and will vehemently oppose the bigoted agenda that they subscribe to and these lakhs of protestors are more opposed to violence than these extremist savarkarites  and are heartbroken when some miscreants turn towards violence violent and extremist elements on both sides should be punished by the due process of law jai hindps those who see the world only through one lens will wonder if im a muslim i was born a hindu  but no longer identify with any religion im a proud indian though someone give this man a silver right fucking now youre just clumping all right wing ideology together and calling these people sarvarkarites  which is misleading at bestif you read savarkars writings  he never conflated hinduism with hindutva as you are trying to imply savarkar was actually pretty clear that religion had nothing to do with hindutva what he described as hindutva was a homogenous cultural identity of the subcontinent according to him  which excluded the practices and traditions of abrahamic religions because he believed those were foreign influencesthis is significantly different than the rss  which is a primarily brahmin hindu organisation which believes in intra hindu fragmentation as well  in other words  they do believe in castiest principlesthings that you see nowadays such as all the cow worship and beef ban  etc would not be a thing if people were following savarkaryes  both of these are far right ideological positions and i personally do not agree with any of them and think they are harmful to the countrybut when you are talking about the ideological spectrum as you are in this post  you should recognise that the rss ideology lies even further right to that of savarkar just take  why dont you identify yourself with any religion now? the first paragraph is exactly how id describe myself too absolutely nailed it", "tokenized": [101, 8777, 2157, 5130, 5443, 4654, 7913, 23738, 28350, 22379, 28884, 3593, 6709, 2870, 2004, 1037, 9358, 15061, 2007, 1037, 2187, 21970, 1045, 7370,

for you? long post aheadhi everyonei am currently in my 25th week  late 2nd trimester  and im trying to educate myself about what lies ahead for me i have to zero in on the most important decision  the city of birth  job city? my hometown? husbands hometown?  i need to decide this asap as traveling after 28 weeks april end that is  is generally not advisedwhich brings me to making this post here i want to gather all the information anectodes experiences  in a countdown way  about the dday dweeks if the circumstances allow  i would prefer a normal delivery however  i totally understand how uncertain pregnancies can get i just feel being informed can help us stay less anxious  not panic its going to be long and my thoughts might seem all over the place  so please bear with me here are my questions1  how frequent are the scheduled ob gyn visits in the very last month  assuming a normal pregnancy? currently i visit once a month  for routine check up and milestone mandated tests  flu vaccination  various blood tests  sonography  etc  by scheduled i mean no complication was experienced by the woman or any urgency water breaking  bleeding  etc  occured 2  one lady who had the same obgyn as me when went for her scheduled 37th week visit  was told she will have a csection as the child is getting overweight  weighing 3 kgs then  the obgyn asked her to soon decide which date she would like the surgery to happen and let the doctor know the lady said she however got labor pain the very next day and delivered via vaginal delivery now  i am a little skeptical here  from what ive read  2535 kgs is the average birth weight for newborns in india how can 3 kgs be overweight then? im already very paranoid about the state of deliveries in urban  bigname hospitals and this incident scares me more there is no data public on the number of normal and surgical deliveries a hospital has  so that one can decide  and once youre in  youre in after that  you have to leave everything at the doctor3  one lady who delivered at the same hospital  different obgyn  as me  went at 37 weeks when she felt contractions her cervix was examined twice in a 5 hour span she said she couldnt bear going through that painful examination again and asked for a csection herself  totally fair  my question is  are these cervix examinations by hand so necessary  when theyre leaving the bearing lady in pain? is there no other way  imaging  ultrasound  etc ? my point is those contractions could have been what is called false labor and if not for the pain due to the examination  that lady could have gone home and come again fullterm or when she felt contractions again?4  my sister went for a scheduled visit in 38th week her cervix was examined  she started bleeding she was told to come back if bleeding continued till evening  which it did she had to be operated the next day  after staying in labor room for some 2432 hours this again makes me skeptical about cervix examinations5  whats the countdown going to be like? when does one know that yes  its now that i rush to the hospital should i be scared of just a few drops of blood? should i rush the very first time i experience period like cramps? from my few interactions with mothers  i feel 3738 weeks is the sweet spot where many things happen i know my post gives a lot of distrusting vibes towards doctors  that theyre there to loot us  they try to invent some complication in these sweet spot weeks to push for csections  etc trust me  i would like to be proven wrong hence  im here to collect as much anectodes about false alarms  doctor sending the lady home even after mild contractions as its not time yet instead of asking to schedule a csection  etc as i can5  from what i understand  some women might never experience labor even after 4041 weeks and hence have to be induced are some women induced before that too? what could lead to induction before full term?6  do all women having a vaginal delivery get an epidural other pain medication  or only those who demand it when they get tired  or when they cant bear pain?7  did anyone research natural birth centers? there are many in the major cities  like 1  sanctum birth center  hyderabad  2  birth village  kochi  3  daimaas natural birth center  mumbai  4  apollo cradle  gurugram google reviews are mixed anyone undertook the services of these natural birth centers?so everyone  contribute what you can towards my questions  in general  your pregnancy stories op  post this in r twoxindia as well https  wwwbabycentercom childbirthclass has all you need to know about child birth regarding centers city hospital  i dont know india c section is becoming very much the de facto option which is sad malpractice by doctors most cases natural birth is possible without much medication 3 of my kids were natural born without any medication 4th one  actually our 2nd  she took epidural 1 depends on the risk factors high risk pregnancies require weekly monitoring otherwise bi monthly suffice2 3 is average and is by no means overweight   3 cervical examination is done to check how much the cervix has dilated i was checked every hour when i went in while in labor  about 34 times  ended up with a emergency c section as large baby + baby in distress4 any bleeding in late term  even if its due to cervical examination needs to be monitored unless the doctor did a membrane sweep  there shouldnt really be a bleeding but then again depends on sensitivity i guess5 i had a cervical check a day prior to my labor  i was at week 39 and very close to my due date  and i had no bleeding but went into labor naturally much later at night i woke up with back pain after midnight and i just knew this was it went to the loo  water broke  told my husband it was time and then woke up my parents waddled to hospital 2 hours later after i timed my contractions and knew they were getting a min apart 6 high risk and multiples also indian doctors love inducing women even when they are in labor to reduce the labor time which makes it much harder on the women  i was induced despite being in labor already and the pain shot through the roof 7 only large hospitals can administer pain relief for vaginal birth as most hospitals in india dont have monitoring systems in place to check for contractions and tell the woman to push 8 none i was birthing at my home town so i chose the one which had a sensible doc that would listen to me and not swat my concerns as google led look up water birthing  think theres one in kerala but im of the give birth in hospital opinion as i dont know how equipped these centers are to handle post natal and intensive care for babies all the best best to cross post to the twoxindia sub as well", "tokenized": [101, 3198, 22254, 2401, 11397,

reclusive? how do people make ends meet in such a dire situation? how do they cope with the extreme social isolation and general disregard of a non contributor in a society? what can people do to identify such behaviors? what triggered it for you? is there a way to curb such triggers? if you do relate to this phenomenon please dont shy away and open up about what you feel indians suffer a lot of developmental problems when growing up some people are high functioning despite their inherent problem which often snowballs into something big  its only a matter of time bullying and peer pressure play a huge role in our society and affects our personal decisions how do we mitigate all of this?id love to engage with you guys over here for now and have a better understanding of your expectations and needs to whoever that participates on this thread please be civil and respectful god knows how much people have already suffered the whole concept of hikikomori might be differently perceived in india than what is generally seen in japan india definitely have a fair share of recluse populace  but i doubt the people who stay in isolation for such long time can survive in india most of the parents of hikikomoris in japan have come to accept the fact that their son daughter is a shut in i cant even imagine our parents being like that  especially when we as a country fail to stress the importance of mental health been working for a few months now but i spent around 5 years unemployed prior to itlived with parents still do theyve been supportivecollege was the trigger for me i had zero liking for the course and at the same time didnt really have any interest at all which i could pursue instead so i dragged myself through graduation because something was better than no qualification at allinitially i went through that phase where i punished myself for being a useless loser who fell behind his peers but i never had any dreams or passions with regards to career and stuff so my neet status in itself gradually stopped being too bothersome an issue to handle but every once in a while  when things went south  i wished i had a bearable facade of a purpose to keep myself occupied during those times ive been always been pretty bad at socialising once i went into the neet lifestyle and got completely acclimatised to it  it worsened the matter i stopped keeping in touch with the few friends i had from school i felt as if we inhabited different worlds so there wasnt much to converse about made a few friends online but the came and wenti work now but it hasnt affected my feelings about work and social life working 9 hours a day  6 days a week continues to he an outrageously ridiculous concept to me and i almost never desire to create new connections i cant guess what exactly would have made the difference for me because i remember myself being like this even in my oldest memories", "tokenized": [101, 3198, 22254, 2401, 2024, 2045, 2151, 7632, 3211,

in a country like india i am a corporate governance researcher  and i find rahul yadavs announcements very interesting and disturbing at the same time i will be very interested in knowing his thoughts behind1 how does he plan to have incentives aligned with success of housingcom convince investors that he is motivated  after giving away all his equity to employees 2 is there a grey market for housingcom shares how can employees monetize the gift?3 isnt there regulation in india  that constrain private firms to have less than 50 investors  before becoming public in that case  how can the shares be transferred to employees?4 i have tracked zillow trulia for a while these firms have mapped a larger geography  and onboarded about a 100 000 agents to pay for ads connected to zip codes still they are struggling with their bottomline  agent retention and agent up selling  they treat agents as their revenue sources  not end use customer  if housingcom will be following a similar model  is it having success in onboarding agents? is it having trouble with the unorganized informal nature of real estate agents? what is being done to mitigate it?5 are the online only flash sales of apartments generating any revenue at all? is it a sustainable model for the future?6 what happened behind the scenes and how were the board members pacified to retain the ceo? how did men with big egos and the cash to boost  look beyond the tantrums to come to a rational decision? alright  which one of you requested an ama with this attention whore? are you serious? maza aaega rakhi sawwant of

and struggle all the way  though i will still attempt it what are the options after 12th where i can fulfill my potential which i think is high    and how can i prepare for it you must have understood i am not that kind of a student who likes to study but rather just i am just good at studying  if you get my pointwhat would you suggest me to go for? currently i feel like a lost cause btw i am good

abroad has broader exposure  you can flex your capability and attract curious onlookers the former options are pretty much linear given how the indian academic and social system worksedit as far as preparing for your potential is concerned thats a broad subject matter what are your interests? and how does your capability match with those interests also  how much influence do you exert in driving career choices in the face of pressure from family after all indian parents hold sway over career and marriage decisions  deleted  so i am in 12th about to give jee all i can say is i was probably in the same boat as you pretty decent at studies but didnt want to study but further in 12th you will realise to even clear mains with good percentile you need to study a decent bit so i would say study 34 hours day and life would be much easier towards end of 12th believe me your photographs aint bad", "tokenized": [101, 2507, 2033, 7047, 2072, 2572, 2747, 1999, 6252, 1998, 1045, 3195, 5989, 1999,

to write a fortnightly column i agreed  on condition that  there would be no censorship while occasionally some changes to my text  were made without my consent  there was no attempt to get me to rewrite  my column or change its arguments until this week  when the hindustan times declined to print the column i had sent  which was scheduled to appear on sunday  april 19 i am grateful to the wire for carrying this column in its entirety in a twopart article published last month in the website newslaundry  the writer alpana kishore subjected the project to redesign new delhis central vista to critical scrutiny the  first part  https  wwwnewslaundrycom 2020 03 16 pmshouseonrajpathhowasupereliteiscapturingdelhisland   asked the question why is redeveloping central vista a bigger  priority than fixing the capitals catastrophic air pollution or  plummeting life expectancy?in answering this question  kishore focused on one key element in the  project the provision for a grand new house for the prime minister  on  rajpath such selfindulgence  she argued  may be common in  dictatorships  but was inappropriate for a republic if one thinks of  delhi as akin to london or berlin  a capital of a democracy  then  argues kishore  spending hundreds of crores on a second house for the prime minister ahead  of fixing delhis pressing problems like its catastrophic air pollution  which causes 80 deaths per day and 45 percent of all premature deaths  is a spectacularly insensitive move that puts a powerful elite firmly  above the peoples good on the other hand  if we are in the  beijingpyongyangmoscow axis where citizens are passive spectators  it  is absolutely normalthe  second part  https  wwwnewslaundrycom 2020 03 17 gujaratmodel20thesuperelitesmagicwandtotakeoverpublicspace   of kishores article focused on the process by which the project was  awarded a process marked by secrecy and subterfuge  ending in the  contract going to a firm of architects from gujarat known to be  particularly close to the prime minister this firms previous projects   wrote kishore  had depended for their execution upon the removal of  obstacles like due process  impact assessments  public consultation   and wellestablished global best practices the firms past record  in  sum  was one of consistently manifesting an innate disrespect for the  citizenin concluding her twopart essay  kishore remarkedthe biggest irony remains that a prime  minister from the humblest of backgrounds should yearn for a house on  rajpath  no less  to endorse his vision of personal greatness and  legacy would emmanuel macron demand and  more importantly  get  a house on the champs elyses? can even trump order himself a second  home on the mall? she added it brings back embarrassing memories of  his nameembroidered rs 10lakh suit  only this time the vanity will be  at the taxpayers expensekishores essay has no mention of the covid19 crisis  evidently it  was written before the dimensions of the crisis became known i shall  come to this crisis presently  but let me first state that i share her  concerns entirely this project has been pushed through without wider  consultation with the public  or even with domain experts in  architecture and urban planningin fact  as one who has seen the work of this firm of architects in  ahmedabad at firsthand  i have an additional concern that they are  utterly indifferent to history and heritage a prime example of this was  their design of a second campus for the indian institute of ahmedabad  the original iima campus  designed by louis kahn  beautifully blends  traditional and modern practices  using red brick  open windows  and  courtyards it is a joy to see  walk through  study and teach in its  successor is cold and soulless  built entirely of concrete  those  assigned offices there yearn for a transfer to the original and much  more welcoming campusalso read  in light of the covid19 pandemic  the central vista project should be reviewed  https  thewirein urban covid19centralvistaprojectnewdelhi the prime ministers own justification of the project is that it was  to mark not a personal but a national milestone  the 75th anniversary  of indian independence this is disingenuous  because past anniversaries  overseen by past prime ministers had not called for such a spectacular  extravaganza both the 25th and 50th anniversaries of independence had  been suitably marked  by a special session of parliament apparently   what was good enough for indira gandhi and ik gujral wouldnt quite do  for narendra modito my mind  the modi governments redesign of new delhi brings to  mind not so much living communist autocrats as it does some dead

before the coronavirus pandemic hit us  this expensive redesign  of the core of the national capital seemed a wasteful and selfindulgent  exercise it has now become much more so for  an economy that was  already flailing has been brought to the brink by the pandemic the  illplanned lockdown has led to enormous human suffering workingclass  indians  already living on the edge  are now faced with utter  destitution  as many economists have argued  the millions of poor indians rendered  poorer by this crisis urgently need financial support from the central  government why cant the funds currently allocated to the central vista  scheme  estimated at rs 20 000 crore and counting  be diverted to  help ameliorate their condition?politically  the burden of this economic  social and humanitarian  crisis is being borne by the states they desperately need money  not  least  the money the centre already owes them a staggering rs 30 000  crore are still due to the states from the centre as their share of  goods and services tax revenues why does this still remain unpaid   while the central vista project has been sanctioned and a schedule for  its tendering announced?also read  what a comparison of great central vistas tells us about modis plans for new delhi  https  thewirein urban whatacomparisonofgreatcentralvistastellsusaboutmodisplansfornewdelhi it will be at least a year  probably longer  before the economy can  begin to fitfully recover the restoration of the social fabric may  take even longer altogether  the country may take at least five  more  likely ten  years before it can return to where it was before covid19  came to our shores surely the moral  political and intellectual  energies of our leaders must be devoted above all to this economic and  social rebuildingin his speeches to the nation since the pandemic broke  the prime  minister has repeatedly asked indians to sacrifice  sacrifice their  time  their jobs  their lifestyles  their human

 customise and book international trips  right from the comfort of your couch over the years  we have helped 10000+ travellers plan and experience their dream vacation our nps score is 72 and we are super hawkish on customer experience we were recently awarded the startup of the year award by tie and travel tech startup winner by ficci  govt of india  coincidentally  we are also celebrating 5 years of pickyourtrail today looking forward to the conversations  update  thanks for the super engaging session folks if there is any more q pls do post and i will answer later in the day tomorrow do follow me on twitter   https  twittercom haripyt  https  twittercom haripyt  and we can continue the convo there as well  a stupid questionhow is your service better different from thomas cook sotc balmerlaurie ? how many times were you close to bankruptcy? when you are bootstrapped how do you decide salary for founders? saw your website and really liked the interface tried planning a euro trip and my questions are based on that relative experience1 am i right in saying that your website does not sell pre packaged travel packages rather it gives the user an option to select from within the preselected vendor options to customise their tour? so essentially you are a marketplace of vendors with a travel layer on top to facilitate bookings?2 your website helps customise an itinerary but optimising the itinerary is still missing anything you are doing to fix that?3 i tried creating an account but your website seems content to let me plan without creating an account which is good but created an itinerary and wanted to save it by logging in and couldnt do that?4 if i directly get in touch with your travel experts to help me create an itinerary will they charge me for thatsorry didnt find that info anywhere? 1 what was your toughest customer service experience?2 what about backpacking options when visiting a country? for example  exploring areas that are not touristy or somewhat secluded3 what are your views on legalizing marijuana in india? would it change tourism sector in any way and would it change your list of offerings?4 lets say a tourist is caught for some illegal activity or a tourist loses their passport how do you handle such unforeseen circumstances? i am very impressed with the website so i decided to see how it works and looked for newzeland as an option and next day onwards i am being called by your representative i received already 3 calls 1 sms and 1 email  hello as someone who has used this service  i have had a mixed experience its a really nice concept to choose the activities and opt out of the things which doesnt seem to interest the individualwe have had hiccups during the trip planning and the trip these could have been better  especially the communication with the overseas partners as well as the visa agents and the ones from pyt who was managing our trip  this was resolved after escalations and the agent was changed  also someone was supposed to get back to me regarding an issue but then forgot to  as this was post the vacation i would have had a better opinion if the person followed through on this than leaving itanyways  my first international vacation was through you guys and i will always remember the good and the bad suggestion  improve the collection of preset activities  what is the motivation behind this project? also  how did you get your first paying customers?  deleted   deleted   deleted  any job openings?  are you hiring for digital marketing? did the ama finish?  removed  what are the payment options? do you support national travel? are you planning to in future? one thing that bugs me about travel agencies in general is that none of them are upfront about where they get their margins from if an agent tells me  up front  that this is the itemized bill for your itinerary  plus this is my x profit  id gladly pay up  if i can verify that the items in the bill match whatever i see on  bookingcom  https  bookingcom  or  hotelscom  https  hotelscom  or whereverotoh if an agent doesnt reveal this  i have no visibility on how much  and where  the travel agent is making his money  leading to the suspicion that i am being ripped off at every point and if i have to constantly doublecheck his rates  i might as well do the same thing myselfi and my family of 4 have made four international trips  two in asia  two in western europe  over the last 9 years  and for the last european vacation we did all the research online booking visas ourselves it was an exhasting time consuming process  and i would have gladly paid extra for a trustworthy agent hi hari  i am om how do you do? just checked the site and did some planning for trips that i have already done and your costs are pretty decent to be honest only thing that i would like to ask is how do you handle situation where someone faces some issue with the hotel   where its your clients word against the hotel? and how will u arrange for a hotel in middle of night if the client does not wnat to stay and wants to change the hotel becuase of some valid reason this is most important becuase even  single ruined night will ruin the next few days of tge trip and also your repeat business hi hari  congratulations on accomplishing this huge milestone i didnt know you guys were that old    my questions can you regale a story anecdote incident  from a customers perspective  on how smooth the said pyt customer experience is? how has your perspective on personalization and customer experience changed from day 0 till today? what plans for the future? what should pyt customers should be excited about? hey this is the first time ive heard about the website had a look and it looks quite neat how much of your traffic pick from the available packages and how much is custom plans?whats an upcoming destination request that you get the most in the last year?", "tokenized": [101, 7632, 10047, 21291, 2522,

the temporary residents saying that they are only visa holders so government has no responsibility in contrast to this  all foreigners in portugal with pending applications will be treated as permanent residents from monday until at least july 1  this ensures migrants have access to public services during the corona virus outbreak applicants including asylum seekers need only provide evidence of an ongoing request to qualify  granting them access to the national health service  welfare benefits  etc temporary residents in australia are not even covered by national health insurance scheme and beleive me many dont have health insurance our own temporary visa holders in australia wont be getting any benefit from their government while aussie citizens and pr holders will be entitled to receive benefits  many people on visas even those who pay the same amount of tax and are as disadvantaged by the situation  will now be asked to fend for themselvesmeanwhile when it affects their own citizens all the rules go out of the window  for example recently australian government allowed all international students to work unlimited hours as opposed to normally allowed 20 hours a week  as long as they are working in supermarkets stocking shelves for aussiesi am hearing news from smaller towns and cities for example adelaide  where some indian groceries are helping students giving free rations as many have lost their casual jobson top of that  many people who came to india on bridging visas which has condition to return back within 3 months  australian government has placed travel restrictions for 6 months  yes it only applied to temporary visas doesnt matter if you are living there from last 510 years now these people are stuck in india and many have lost their dream of getting residency  whats worse is they cant even go back to settle their affairs and sell their belongings  say their goodbyes the government refuses to extend the deadline on

lies about how caa has nothing to do with indians they talked about how minorities are being prosecuted in pakistan bangladesh  how women are being forcefully converted or raped in these countries  or how minorities went from 25 to 5 in these countries without any source for that information  some argued that seattle should deal with its own problems of homelessness  drugs and crime instead of falling prey to hatemongering one person even claimed that there is a  genocide of hindus going on in india and the population of hindus went down to 65  https  youtube wwygrq6oxuq?t1920  many people laughed at that some accused the council member kshama sawant and her political aspirations and her ulterior motives behind this resolution some even went on to claim that all these protests against

they left the hall? utterly despicable well done  seattle council and well done all those who worked so hard to create and table this resolution so uh  will the international pressure help? what if they become even more authoritarian? thanks op for the video link and tldw this was a good watch wish we had neutral courtrooms here also  im sad to see how propoganda has consumed highly educated folks all over the globe if over they open their ears and minds to the other side of the story these sanghi bhakts are the same everywhere innit spew lies  shout  disrupt and then blame everyone else apart from themselves good job for chronicling all this  op with bhakts  its painfully evident that while they feel greatly for the persecuted minorities  their hatred for muslims is much more in magnitude a bhakt who is truly for the persecuted hindu minority would have suggested inclusion of all religions so that relief for persecuted hindus is expedited in the light of the protests of course bjps doesnt give two shits about the persecuted hindus their endgame is mostly wb polls where they stand to immensely gain if the muslim illegals are disenfranchised   who currently are part of the mamta vote bank  un should pass a resolution against caa nrc impose sanctions  if required whatever it takes  the spirit of india must be saved nice to see the council focused on the real issues of the city always wondered why shit never got done in seattle thanks hasnt us  france and israel supported caa or my facebook feed is broken? again this only highlights biggest red flag with muslims  there i said it  bury me  that religion  nation why are they talking about india in seattle they are just hacking the democratic processes and have misplaced loyalties i want to see one passed against china bunch of hypocrites its like saying happy mahoram to a muslim it is insulting  unrelated  how can mahoram be happy?  and does not make sense seattle isnt even in india not saying caa is right or wrong", "tokenized": [101, 5862, 2103, 2473, 4150, 1996, 2034, 2149, 4884, 2303, 2000, 3413, 1037, 5813, 2114, 6187, 2050, 2440, 2678, 1997, 1996, 4994, 1998, 1996, 3789, 2008, 2628, 15222, 2015,

ive been looking for a new job for the last 3 months but havent been able to find anything a lot of times companies just dont process your resume after looking at your previous salary this has been very apparent in software professionals who switched to a software job in a financial institution  jpmc  nomura etc  and then left it is 16 lakh a decent salary for an elite mba grad? do you think number of jobs have decreased in the market now as compared to say 3 years ago? hah 3 months is rich  tookme 6 to even get a job hold tight man   it will come did you take education loan  if yes then how much  if no then what was your total kharcha for the mba? as someone who is doing a job after bba and is stuck between doing papa ka business or making a career by myself is mba worth the 2030l of investment? i am 33 year old planning to do 1 year mba from iim a b c l or xlri i am typical indian it male  iim  with average academics reason for mba i am working in it service industry for past 9 years and always intrested in learning and growing but now my growth is staganat and only option is to get into management so why not get mba degree and jump state career as manager in itshould i do mba ? keep looking buddy you will find the job soon is it worth doing an mba  if even without it youre earning that much within roughly 4 years of graduating? vaguely related  but as a non indian it has always wondered me why so many people start an mba at such a young age in india in the netherlands  where i am from  it is considered very weird to do an mba without having at least around 45 years of work experience combined with the fact that most people enter the workforce here at a later age as well results in most people taking their mba while being in their late 20s early 30s and isnt that the original purpose of an mba anyway  to do it only after having a decent amount of experience  but i might be misguided here ? its been tough  but while searching for new openings i hope youre also enjoying this free period while it lasts   hope it doesnt last too much though      btw apart from the money you made  you regret anything about the professional world of the elites? what job role were you doing? which location are you looking for? mba in what?i may be able to refer you if something matches will you work in a company that would pay 2030 less than your previous pay? among hr  marketing and finance if you had to pick one which would you select based on the demand? was the company a startup? campus placement? can relate to this situation hope you land a good job   incase you are looking for some leads  do dm we are hiring in my team need good finance knowledge how why did your company go bankrupt? at what age did you get your job at 14 lakhs pm ? what was your cat ile gmat?  optional p do you regret taking a niche job instead of consulting ib etc ?does your academic history before mba matter much after mba? why did it fail? and what do you think the founders management could have done differently to save it? what would have you done? also  is the product still out there? i feel joy in reviving past broken failed products  if only money was a

recently tapedout one of our cores on intels 22 ffl technology node and have been successful in powering on the chip and booting linux on it this is a io heavy test chip meant to provide a poc proof of concept  and is not meant for direct consumption  we are excited to answer your queries ask us anythingour new website   shaktiorgin  https  shaktiorgin editthanks for your queries r india it was a pleasure interacting with guys glad to see many tech enthusiasts in herehope to see you in a new ama with our new processor we are signing off thanks again hi  im excited to see you taking an ama i heard about your recent tapeout of shakti cores the second public tapeout of riscv in the world congratulationsi have a few questions1  i understand the stages of software design  but hardware is opaque can you give us a overview of the stages of processor design? what stages cost the most time? which ones take the most manpower? 1a  i remember reading that amd zen team spent 2 million man hours over 4 years to design the replacement to excavator since i dont understand much about hardware  how can a small group of entrepreneurs and academics hope to put up the enormous amount of effort needed to build and validate a processor design?2  can you elaborate on your power  performance  area and especially security design goals for your server and desktop class processors? ive read your website but it only mentions features and clockrate of the processors compared to the best intel server and desktop chips of 2018  what is your performance goal? 50 as good? 80?2a  im not asking you to commit to delivering chips on any time frame  but once again  due to my ignorance of hardware  i dont have any idea of how long your chip design efforts will take to meet your design goals for servers and desktop as detailed in 2   how long do you estimate it will take your team to design these chips? 5 years? 10 years?3  im given to understand that the x86 processor family was not designed for security the processor design grew organically over time  so its as full of holes as swiss cheese what systematic hardware and software design changes  if any  are you taking to avoid the security failures of x86  arm and mips family?4  im concerned about the security of riscv chips the chip design world is spending a lot of time and money to formally verify the riscv isa and creating chip designs  but theyre writing drivers and other hardware level software in c or c++  which has had almost 50 years to prove itself insecure i understand that you will need to write code in c for linux related matters  and i dont expect that to change however  have you considered using more secure languages like rust for software that does not have to be in c c++? im pointing this out because whatever language you use for your riscv project is going to be in use 50 years from now i really dont want to be using insecure software in 2068 have you given any thought to this? you have stated on your bitbucketsite that there will be six  or eight  versions of cores  i have seen progress on three of those what is the timeline for the rest of the processors?  another question have you guys considered a copyleft license for your project like cern open hardware license? bsdstyle licenses allow for oneway transfer of intellectual property  whereas copyleft licenses like cohl keep the pool of intellectual property in the public domain using a permissive license like bsd will make it very easy for companies to take your design and make it proprietary  but its not the right license if you want to create a open hardware ecosystem why would a company like samsung take your design and put 250 million dollars of investment to take it to the next level of quality  if the bsd license allows apple to show up  take the results of samsungs hard work and make it proprietary? bsd and linux projects have been around for the same length of time  but while linux has taken over the world  bsd is stagnant companies dont use permissive licenses for software unless they control that stack and its not a core part of their business permissive licences create silos but an open hardware community needs a twoway  copyleft license due to the incentives your license creates  i expect companies and academics to take your work but not give anything back an open hardware community based on your teams work is all but impossible have you considered changing the shakti projects license? hey therefirst off  great job and congratulations what advice would you give to a 2nd year student who loves processors and wants to learn how to build them? where would you have me start with this and what resources  books  software  etc  are available? thanks in advance  amazing work have few queries1 any plans to develop custom unix based os for the processor? 2 any plans to make integrated gpgpu system with industry? what is the process involved in testing these chips? hi  u shaktiteam  welcome to  r india here are some of the questions that were posted on the announcement threadfrom  u nascentmind will you be selling cheap development boards for the community to contribute? i am eager to get my hands on it and would like to contributefrom  u broine hi  thank you for the ama since you mentioned interconnect fabrics  and i am speculating from the pov of high performance computingwhat are the prospects of risc based systems for taking over the next generation of hardware?from  u mynameissomethingtoo congratulations to you guys this is unrelated  but would you like to comment on the spectre and meldown vulnerabilities recently detected in intel chips? can you guys dumb down what exactly had happened and why was everyone freaking out?from  u modiibom questions  because i will surely miss the time slot 1  any timeline of when we will see these processors on a motherboard?2  can we see dmesg output?3  when should we expect indian supercomputer with these chips running? will intel withhold their facilities when they come to know that these chips will be used for supercomputing purpose? can taiwanese fabs be roped in at that time?from  u dylan522p why are you using intel 22nm ffl over a more standard fab for a first tapeout model  such as tsmc 28nm?from  u innovator116 i am emphasizing here as i have said globally  that risvv will need small scale semiconductor fabs model to become ubiquitous when small groups will not just be able to implement risvv based microprocessors but manufacture them as well locally my question is  has the iitm team has reached out to iisc groups working on nanopatterning lithography technologies? a national consortium to design  develop and manufacture ics domestically is need of the hour proprietary hardware is bound to contain backdoors for americans or chinesefrom  u upsky7 do you plan on releasing everything as foss  100 libre   even the gpu?from  u kipboye hey there first off  great job and congratulations what advice would you give to a 2nd year student who loves processors and wants to learn how to build them? where would you have me start with this and what resources  books  software  etc  are available? thanks in advancefrom  u pcein great to see the amazing work you are doing  and thanks for the ama a few questions    can a hobbyist like me try out the shakti processor on an fpga dev board  like the zedboard ?    you mentioned a rust based os for supporting tagged isas in a recent hn post are any details regarding this available?    at the moment  shakti seems like a mostly iitmonly project  any plans on getting the foss community involved in it to a greater extend? hi paul  ssup  so prod to see this day  never thought i would see a batch ate of mine doing an ama on randia  so how long before this will be ready for applications in real world?  right now i think the manufacturing is done in the us  are there any plans for manufacturing in india?  is only gcc and glibc ported as well?  i always thought risc processors were more suited for lowpower embedded applications til you can also put them in hpcs  1 if i had the hardware  what is the fastest way to compile simple c code ? what tools do i need?  2 im bit rusty on systems knowledge  but writing llvm backend for risc must be more difficult than  say x86? because adapting generated ir would be exposed to more instructions?  3 are there any plans to make a gpgpu using riscv ? 4 are you guys hiring? for what positions?  deleted   deleted  great to hear about your progress a couple of questions1 are you going to stick with riscv for the foreseeable future or are you open to getting arm mips licenses and changing out the front end to support a different  and more market oriented  isa?2 any timelines on the i class cores? those would be the most important for any kind of server hpc efforts im guessingthanks for taking the time to do this thank you for doing this i have read into your new amazing webpage and also seen the presentation from neel gala at chennai what is the difference between the aeon and the fclass as well as the difference between the tclass and aegis?  have you run coremark ulpmark on it? hello congratulations on your great success i was aware of your teams work through kunal ghosh here are my questions q1 do you plan to ship a bit of fpga fabric  customizable logic  along with riscv cores? it might help us to build accelerators for some common tasksq2 is it the riscv instruction set as it is or some extra instructions have been included like single cycle mac for developers who might be interested in using it for dsp?q3 iit madras has a very strong data converters team under the very famous shanthi pavan any plans to integrate a adc and or a dac? will be useful for dsp and senser node applications i read it as ama with shaktiman n was like wtf for few seconds  does the license allow other organizations to build on top of your design? arduino like movement?i would love to try a sbc like raspberry pi but with shakti i have seen in the latest workshop from the riscv foundation that there is a company started by neel gala and g s madhusudan called incore semiconductors what is the universitys relationship to this company and who is developing what? thanks in advance and for doing this ama  i have heard that the government is very interested in the project and is sponsoring it to some extent what does this mean for india and the ability to be independent of other countries? is this something that is seen as a big deal or is it just a side benefit?", "tokenized": [101,

pizza for letting the sick employee work? my society banned delivery orders after this  which is so fucking retarded i was anyway coming downstairs and collecting food from the gate  now even that is banned in case i accidentally spread the virusthere needs to be some common sense if tomorrow news comes out that some dmart employee half way across the country was infected  does that mean now that we cant go get groceries from any dmart? i guess its kind of a cmv i was thinking about how cooking food requires daily interaction with local grocers for veggies and wanted to compare it with ordering food under lockdown ps i can do both 1 supposing delivery executives do 15orders a day  they get to interact with 30 different people a grocer will be interacting daily with suppliers and customers and the count would be much higher2 you going to the grocer means interacting directly with a potential carrier since they are interacting with more people  you meeting a delivery executive should be lower risk because the executive would at max be an intermediate carrier and and 2nd degree3 the employee was a a box8 employee i am not sure if they are as strict and vigilant as swiggy or zomato4 ordering meat dishes will always be more nutritious than cooking eggs and veggies provided the cost is affordable5 the only con i can think of with delivery executives is that they will be driving to all parts of the city  even potential virus hotspots you grocer will be in your locality his suppliers might come from other parts but in this case grocer becomes 2nd degree the suppliers and customers would also be almost same everyday while for delivery executives they would almost certainly be meeting different people every daymy mind is biased towards ordering and so i wanted to get some counter arguments and whether my line of thinking is correct here currently i order only curry while i make rice roti at home this makes me order once or twice in two days if you are ordering

business#x200b lets start with some basic concepts first 1  invoicing the act of giving a bill for the products or services utilized by a customer for most people  this is a simple receipt at the end of a meal for instance  or at the checkout counter of a clothing store for the clothes youve purchased  or a bill given by a cleaning service for cleaning their homesbut for an organization  an invoice is the means to collect money from a client anything that is sold to a client will generate an invoice for the products delivered services rendered the invoice will also have the tax details  gst number  billing address  registered address  shipping address  list of items that need to be paid for  applicable tax  cgst  igst  sgst  payment due date  and authorized signatures an invoice is a means to collect cash from the client without a proper invoice  cash cannot be collected this is where the problem starts since not having a proper invoice gives a lot of ground to the client to delay the payment#x200b  2  the process of invoicing   invoicing function in an organization once the product is delivered or the services rendered  or sometimes before they are delivered  invoicing is triggered  meaning that a bill is generated and the money has to be collected from the client this is usually done through an erp like sap or oracle the invoice then reaches the collections department  where the collection manager submits the invoice to the client for verification and payment the collection managers are the front line people tasked with bringing money into the organization they are one of the most important people for running the business because their performance impacts the cash flow of the organizationthey are normally tagged to accounts  aka clients one collection manager could be handling anywhere from one client to thousands  depending on the nature and size of their clientsonce the client verifies the invoice  the money is transferred to the selling organization and it becomes revenue and subsequently profit for themif the client holds the invoice for any reason  then it becomes lost revenue or a bad debt  loss  for the selling organization the longer the client holds this money  the lesser the value that money holds due to the concept of timevalue of money 100 rupees today is considered as more money than 100 rupees one month from now due to the timevalue of money thus a delayed payment impacts the profitability of the organization 3  gst for the services industry gst dictates that the invoicing for services will be done in the state where the services have been delivered i will explain this concept in detail as this is the crux of the problem to start off  i will outline a simple sale and how that sale would translate into the pregst and postgst eraproblem statement assume that tata motors intend to buy 5000 chairs for their offices from pepperfry for 50 lakh rupees tata motors also wants pepperfry to install the chairs in their offices  5 lakh rupees   and then provide 5 years warranty including a checkup every year to determine the life of the chair  and any repairs required  15 lakh rupees  tata motors wants the chairs to be delivered to 50 offices in india  across 20 different states this is a mix of products  chairs   services  installation and maintenance  the total bill is for 70 lakh rupees 5000 chairs  inr 50 lakhsinstallation of chairs in 50 offices across 20 states  inr 5 lakhsmaintenance of chairs for 5 years  inr 15 lakhspepperfry sales executives will take the purchase order from tata motors and put the order into their system the input of the purcahse order will trigger three functionsa  delivery of the products  servicesb  invoicing and payment for the orderc  postsale service  maintenancepregst invoicingbefore gst came into the picture  the above bill would be generated by pepperfry as a single bill centrally ie they would generate a bill for 70 lakhs  with the extra relevant vat and the tax details of the two organizations this would be on one single bill for the entire deal  irrespective of state  city  etc they would just give tata motors one single piece of paper saying that they are owed 70 lakhs with the due date for the paymentmanoj who is pepperfrys collection manager for tata motors will submit this single invoice at the tata motors office where it will be checked by the tata motors procurement and finance teams  and if there is nothing wrong with the invoice  the payment will be cleared off by the due dateagain the point to focus on here is that only one invoice is needed for the delivery of the chairs and services to the entire country manoj has to submit just one invoice  follow up on invoice  and collect the payment on one invoice tata motors teams have to verify one invoice  and process the payment on one invoice only one tax number and billing address is needed on the invoice because it is being done centrallyif there is something wrong with the invoice  manoj has to correct only one invoice and resubmit it to tata motors#x200b postgst invoicinglike i mentioned before  gst dictates that the invoicing be done in the state where the services have been delivered ie separate gst filing for all states explaining further this means that a separate invoice has to be generated for each state that is involved in the transaction if this one state involved  one invoice if two states are involved  then two invoices if five states are involved  then five invoices and in this case since twenty states are involved  twenty invoices#x200b the values of the invoices are split in direct proportion to the usage if 100 rs is the total bill value  in three states  maharashtra  up  kerala with 603010 usage  then the bills will bemaharashtra  60up  30kerala  10so in a sense it is a separate company in each state in terms of gstmoving on to the implication in the tata motors  pepperfry transactionsince the chairs have to be delivered in 20 states  tata motors  pepperfry will have to have a registered office in all twenty states along with a gst number for each state tata motors will have to issue 20 purchase orders in the proportionate value to pepperfry ie 70 lakhs split proportionally into 20 states the sales executive will enter twenty purchase orders into the system then deliveries will be triggered for 20 states and 20 different invoices will be handed over to manoj after generationmanoj will submit 20 invoices to pepperfry  whose procurement department will then verify 20 invoices  give it to finance to verify and then initiate 20 payments then 20 payments will be received by tata motors  with 20 banking transaction ids  and manoj will verify the 20 payments and close the transaction for now this is the ideal scenarioas you might have been able to tell  the effort required by everyone involved in the deal has gone up 20 times this effort required will be the same as before if there is only one state involved on the buying side  ie maharastra selling to maharashtra itll be twice the effort if two states are involved on the buying side  ie maharashtra selling to up  kerala it has a possibility of going upto 36 time the effort required previously for the same amount of money since there are 29 states and 7 union territories yes union territories are treated separately as well#x200b the impact from this is 1  efficiency effort pepperfry is still going to make 70 lakhs on the deal but the effort required will be twenty times that of before because tata motors will give 20 purchase orders on which 20 invoices will be generated the time taken to process these invoices is the same because their value does not impact the time taken to collect the money on them this is because each invoice will be the same template  its just that their  values will be different examplemaharashtrachairs  inr 5 lakhsinstallation  inr 50ksupport  inr 15 lakhskeralachairs  inr 3 lakhsinstallation  inr 30ksupport  inr 90kupchairs  inr 10 lakhsinstallation  inr 1 lakhsupport  inr 3 lakhsthe total money being collected is the same as before but the sales executive  manoj  the procurement guy  the finance guy have to do 20 times the work for it with no other added valuetheir efficiency in this scenario has gone down to 5 but it can arguably go down to 27 if all states and union territories are involved  although this is a rare casealso like i said that this is the ideal scenario it doesnt always go this smoothly some of the challenges encountered area  incorrect proportions of purchase orders   invoices someone made a mistake if 10 needed to be allocated to up  then theyve allocated 11 or 15 the process has to be repeated again after finding the faultb  incorrect gst on po   invoice suppose a particular invoice has the wrong gst  it means that it cant be processed on incorrect tax information  which means that that money cant be collected on that invoice before gst there would be one wrong tax number  now it could be one or two or twenty mistakes happen in the real life this is one of the most common things we face mistakes happened before gst as well  now they just happen in multiples and we really cant expect people to make mistakes because they always will again efficiency goes down as multiple times the effort is required to fix the mistakesc  missing gst it isnt necessary that all companies will have a gst registration in every state so tata motors might not have a registered office in 2 states for example ie they wont have a gst number they will now have to provide a declaration to pepperfry saying that they dont have a gst number for two states  and then pepperfry will be able to give them the invoice the payment of the money is delayed till then getting that declaration in my experience takes a long time because if tata motors says that  they arent able to claim input tax credit in that state thats like leaving money on the table for them  and getting this declaration basically saying that they are willing to lose money on the transaction  requires approvals upto the highest levels because it is a loss to the company manoj now has to follow up on two more time consuming things to get the same amount of money and thus efficiency goes down further 2  cash flow cash is the lifeline of a company a company without cash cannot survive they could be valued at a billion dollars but if they dont have cash to pay their employees  they will shut down kingfisher couldnt pay their employees  interest  vendors because they didnt have cash left  same for jet  again doesnt have cash for payment of salaries  fuel  loan payments  etc bsnl again is struggling to pay for things because they dont have cashthus a healthy cash flow is one of the most important aspects of the business or for the survival of the company if companies were people  cash flow would be the oxygen invoicing is how cash is brought into the companybecause of the decrease in efficiency of the collection managers  a delay is introduced in the collection of the cash so if pregst cash was being collected in 25 days  now it would be taking say 45 days because the collection managers efficiency has gone downand the tiny delays add up incorrect gst  add another 7 days for that cash to be collected  missing gst  add 15 days  etcthis has two outcomesfirstly  because pepperfry had earlier predicted that theyll get the money in 30 days but they are now receiving it in 45 days  that means the 70 lakhs they need at the 30th day for their daily expenses now needs to be found from somewhere else since this 70 days will now be coming after another 2 weeks they will have to dip into the reserves for 15 dayssecondly  the money has lost some value it was 70 lakhs at the end of 30 days but now since time has passed  it has lost some value due to the time value of money it couldve generated interest or it couldve been invested but now this is delayed and hence some value is lost this is a loss to pepperfryto summarize  gst has delayed the payment cycle of the company it now takes longer to collect the same amount of money than it used to before gst was introduced if money takes longer to come in  it takes longer to go out  salaries  interest payments  vendor payments  and other outflows are impacted 3 profit the profit made on a deal varies from company to company and deal to deal let us assume that pepperfry made 10 profit on this deal ie 7 lakhs due to the following factors this profit will get impacteda  the payment cycle is delayed so theyre collecting the profit after a longer duration they will have to collect 63 lakhs before they start making a profit this could be after say theyve collected 13 of the 20 invoices the remaining 7 will give them their profit so basically profit generation is delayed because the cash flow has been delayed this means that the profit made on the deal has lost some value if pregst this was 7 lakhs  now itll be less than 7 lakhs in value due to the time value of money and again because efficiency has gone down  the effort required to generate the same amount of profit has gone up  and thus the profit on the deal has actually gone downb  there are 20 invoices to process not all will always go through many will get stuck and the payment will be delayed or may never come due to the process issues the money that will just linger there and never come to pepperfry will become a bad debt to them if the invoice gets stuck for some reason like incorrect gst  missing gst  incorrect value  the cash wont be collected for that invoice and that amount will get reduced from the profit so because the invoice hasnt gotten processed  the 7 lakhs profit will now be less say 5 lakhs if more than 7 lakhs is not collected on the deal  then pepperfry will actually make a loss on the dealthe biggest culprits of this are psus like hpcl  bpcl  ubi  etc their requirements are so stringent that if there is a single mistake and they hold the invoice this payment could get delayed for years and thus the profit on the deal is impacted they just wont pay till everything on the invoice is correct or they could delay for multiple other reasons many businesses dont sell to psus because of this reason  their profits and cash get stuck in doing business with themthis is different from pregst because earlier if say there was a mistake  there was one invoice to fix now there could be many for the same amount of revenue as before  now chances are you wont make the same amount of profitthus due to the lowered efficiency  longer payment cycle and stuck payments  the profit made has gotten impacted#x200b in conclusion to my ramblings  due to the statespecific nature of gst  the effort required to make the same amount of money as the pregst era has gone up this has impacted the revenue and thus the profit made by companies and these are problems that everyone will face because of how gst is if you want to do business in multiple states  you will have to be ready to face these challengesfeel free to discuss the impact this will have on our economy in my opinion it has had a big impact but i really need someone much more knowledgeable than me to analyze and publish that i feel this deserves a conversation at the very least because this one change has impacted revenue and profit extensively  it has made making money harder and thus is going to have a lasting impact on the economy the worst part is it doesnt look like this system is going to change in the near future#x200b ill probably put a tl dr later that was a very enlightening read  thank you for the detailed explanations and examplesso far  id only read handwavy statements like gst is a gamechanger from ivory tower economists  but voices on the ground like yours are the ones that show reality this line in particular surprised metata motors  pepperfry will have to have a registered office in all twenty states along with a gst number for each stateits fcked up that govt expects a service provider to have registered office in every state of the client i know its too long i wanted to do justice to the issue i got tired of writing it lol but ive tried to put down as many details as possible to explain it the anyone who reads it i know the formatting is fucked ill fix that later too this is very good  even with the occasional oversimplification you explained everything clearlyhaving to maintain gst registrations in multiple states  especially for service companies  where the service is usually delivered over the internet  without any goods moving from one state to another  is a huge painone nation one tax my ass yeah  to add to all this1 if you raise an invoice  you have to pay gst the next month without fail whether you can collect the payment or not2 if youre an sme  you have to constantly track whether the seller is filing his sales so that you get input tax on purchases3 make stupid eway bills every time you send material out of the state and make sure they are the same as invoicebureaucrats make these rules on paper and flowcharts without having the experience to earn a single rupee in their life and make us go through with all this bullshit someone is doing more work than our finance minister my ca was telling me that the government has some new regulation in the works that you have to use the sarkari gst software to upload invoices on a daily basis he said it hasnt been put into effect yet but if he is right  that sounds like a disaster for traders very informative post  this is the kind of posts that make reddit india worth browsing  thanks for listing this out imo gst is the single biggest reason behind the current economic slowdown and what you have listed is one of the biggest reasons somehow the taxation and mca rquirements have increased manifold under the modi regime but they are not being called out in the newspapers anywhere the left is busy labelling modi whatnot but they arent willing to go into the details of what is actually wrongthe problem is that the congress left started out by calling modi suitboot ki sarkar now they cant even turn on their blame because in reality modi government is all about more effective taxation as much as possible all of the modi govt initiatives  demo  increased mca compliance  gst  angel tax results in more and more taxation  what they dont get is that in the process of making taxation more effective they have dramatically increased compliance costs for most businessmen and this is negatively impact the economy modi govt is actually more leftists than the left would like to admit and because modi is doing these leftish shenanigans  the left is reduced to calling him names rather than criticise him on policy and specifics i dont understand gst that well  but i used to run a company in the past  pre and post gst era  its still running  but ive moved on whenever we had an outofstate client  we used to raise an invoice with igst  as opposed to cgst sgst split for instate clients wouldnt that simplify the invoicing?like  the head branch of tata motors in mumbai raising a single invoice with igst to the head branch of pepperfry in delhi? as mentioned earlier  i might have got this totally wrong  as i dont completely understand how gst works with large organizations operating in multiple states working with several vendors spread all over the country looks like an excellent saturday read thanks you very my good sir will go thru it later thanks so much  u zaplinaki for making this post and taking the time to explain in all these detailswould you be interested in crossposting in  r indiainvestments ? you just get charged igst if company doesnt have a office gst in the state of receipt of supplywe receive goods from haryana and pay 28 igst on it me what did feku do in 5yrsbhakts demo  gstme neither of them are achievementsbut peanut sized brains that bhakts have dont realize this nobody is coming here because this thread exposes that gst is fucked up feku can do only one nation one insert new nonsense here no tldr  nor read it seriously is too long bc my thumb got tired scrollingbesides tadipaar wants to know your address", "tokenized": [101, 1996, 4254, 1997, 28177, 2102, 2006, 1999, 6767, 23553, 1998, 2947, 2006, 6599,

doing community testing so the actual number of positive cases is much higher tell your parents that you have a higher chance of catching the virus travelling because it involves airportstry to

keep calling people at home multiple times a day to check on them and assure them that youre ok travel is the risky part i am in the same dilemma but then i decided that it is better to stay put than

opted for science after the board exams realized i wont even pass  had to fight with family members to change it to commerce and i passed with 57 marks came to mumbai to study ca  estimated around 25 lakhs as fees  expenses   couldnt afford that  i  had interest in technology so decided to pursue it instead learned computer engineering  hardware networking  for one year  and got a job at a mnc  worked in that field for 6 years i was just 17 when joining this job  a didnt complete my graduation around 5th year in my job i realized i had more interest in building things on the internet than fixing active directory problems i started learning more and more about it  and build a real blog which got decent visitors and started to make some money  but to really make something worthwhile i had to dedicate more time  i used to live in virar and traveling to andheri  mumbai  every day for job took 9 hrs + 4 hrs of my time and after that hectic peak hour mumbai local the body simply didnt want to work anymore  so in around 2013 i left my job and decided to move full time into internet marketing my wife  her parents and my mom all thought i have gone mad and pretty stupid and honestly thats pretty much fucked up if you ask any one of that age for next 12 months i built websites around local businesses in uk   ranked them and sold the leads to two companies the most successful of them was one was around heavy transport vehicle driving training the company paid 35 per lead and i made more than 4k per month  around 2l in inr  with it  this boosted my confidence and i invested most of those funds into experimenting and investing in digital marketing i used to post my screenshots on facebook  in 2014 a random dude msged out of nowhere and asked to meet   he looked confident and we meet at a google conference later that week  we discussed what we both has been doing he had lots of contacts at emerging companies and i had the skills  strategies   and contacts to actually delivery successful marketing campaigns   it was a promising match and we end up forming a company together we built a digital agency  the first client he brought gave us over two crores in revenue we quickly built a team of about 40 ninjas and went on to become a very successful company in next 3 years we worked with more than a dozen listed companies  3 fortune 500 company and made a lot of money for ourselves  at materialistic levels  just last year he bought a very expensive car  80 lakhs   travelled to over 30 countries and i bought  a expensive home  3bhk powai  25 cr   we are still partners and have been doing great so far and hopefully will continue to at multiple times in my career i had to fight with my own people  go against the wind to make my way  point of all this is  you reddit guys are tech adopters and are technically more advanced than the general public  there is a lot of people who are stuck at a job they hate but cant do shit about it either for family pressure or a dozen different reasons for you  i strongly recommend that in your free time develop a skill  mostly in a area you enjoy doing   and use that skill to compliment your primary source of income once you are confident enough and have some numbers  revenue  to back it up  take a leap of faith and see where it takes   dont worry about failure  if you fail  getting a job is the easiest thing to do   i agree that the being a  entrepreneur is volatile and there is no security but so is everything else  just see how many people gets fired everymonth with no where to go and they all wonder if they could make something like that parents ko bus paise chaiye as long as they see you are making good enough   they will be fine sooner or later   my father inlaw loves to flaunt when i share my photos with a bmw and mom makes dozens of calls telling all relatives whenever she purchase something expensive  they just want to see you happy  its just that their scale of happiness is a bit off  trust them to trust you thanks for sharing  somewhere there is a person that is at a cross road  who will read this and  your lessons maybe the push they need  wish you continued success  deleted  i

helpi am 21 year old guy who has made many mistakes in career choosingafter 10th  i choose commerce due to peer pressure and not thinking about it i would have done science and pursued computer engineeringi am been fascinated by computers and games since i was a kidi have 3 years into llb and i wish to teach myself1 programming2 hacking3 making 2d games or android games4 making apps5 making websitesi want to work from home  even possible be a bug bounty hunter or white hat hacker or work of police cyber cell departmenti am serious in this and will dedicate upwards of 6 hours everyday for 3 yearsis self learning possible  so th i can do something great in field of technology?? yes self taught programmers are a plenty practice makes perfect also patent attorneys are a thing and can be a fulfilling career for many think about being cyber law expert of course self learning is possible but please be realistic about the kind of time you can dedicate to it youre a full time student on top of that do you genuinely think you can add 6 hours of work in a day  everyday?     be more clear about what you want to learn  broad terms like programming and hacking mean nothing and everything else you have listed is a subset of programming not that it is wrong to start from 0  but researching what you want to learn at this stage will benefit you a lot      list out very clearly what you need to do  make a schedule of what you need to do when and weekly track your progress and tweak your program accordingly the most difficult thing about self learning is getting the discipline to do it and for it to be lasting experience you need to be realistic about the number of hours you can give without burning out     you can make a great career for yourself in 3 years even if you are starting from 0  ossu is a great list of curated courses  you dont have enough time to do all of them but you do have enough time to learn whatever aligns with your career goals also restricting yourself to just moocs is quite fruitless  make projects  try contributing to open source projects  since you are a registered student you are eligible for gsoc please look into that   and get relevant internships in startups since the bigger companies will shy away from you at this point      again i would like to emphasize be clear about your goals and asking specific questions will fetch you much better and much more useful responses from everyone you should join  pwnsquad  https  pwnsquadnet  it is a discord programming community that welcomes people of all skillsetswe share cool learning resources  solve challenges and do fun d just go for it  most of the computer geniuses are college dropouts anyway 1  easy to call yourself programmer2  pick a language  ideally c++  spend a year or two at it  move to assembly language  learn writing assembly go to reverse engineering then learn package injection  hooks and sdk development to hack yourself3  2d games  few months of experience will teach you to code games in epic unity is pretty easy4  making website is easy but again to be reallygood at it you will have to learn java  packet handling server side fetching and a lot of stuffs which you will learn as you progress but sole focus is not worth unless you want to be web developer trust me self thought programmers are all around our country a lot of them even shit over the professionally academically certified ones sorry if it offends anyonehonestly i feel if you can embrace the concept of approaching and solving problems and understand how to convert it into code syntactically  heck even a pseudo code or an understanding as to how it may be executed   you are a programmer just embrace the concepts  keep your code simple  try to work towards improving code efficiently and dont jump around a lot on everything that glitters if you start a concept  finish it or atleast have a good understanding before jumping to the next one have lots of hands on experience and be patient and steady while proceeding rather than reactive and erratic wish you all the best for your venture   https  wwwyoutubecom watch?vupo9imjbpc  https  wwwyoutubecom watch?vupo9imjbpc   check this out  it will be helpful hey dude im a huge advocate of jumping careers that dont work for you into careers that you are really passionate about you can start learning  at least the basics if not advanced  from the following links  https  wwwcodecademycom   https  wwwcodecademycom     https  wwww3schoolscom   https  wwww3schoolscom     https  stackoverflowcom   https  stackoverflowcom   first one teaches you various languages and frameworks  there are paid and free plans the second one is like a dictionary you can use it as a reference guide  free and the third one is a very active forum of developers you can ask any  and i mean any  doubt regarding this field and someone will answer  free hope this helps cheers", "tokenized": [101, 2026, 2222, 2497, 2267,

it is a process mandated by  the indian citizenship   registration of citizens and issue of national identity cards  rules 2003sourcebut are they connected? yessince any rules issued from time to time by the government are taken into consideration while interpreting any law in fact there is a clause in every act specifying the same  in our case  section 18 of the indian citizenship act 1955source2what is the caa  how can it be misused? a  caa and why its unconstitutionalthe core idea is to make it easier for  undocumented immigrants from afghanistan  bangladesh and pakistan to get indian citizenship the catch is that these immigrants cant be muslimsare there really persecuted minorities that would benefit from this legislation?yes  31 313 individuals to be precisethis was revealed by the government itself during a hearing by a parliamentary committee on the 2016 version of the bill the committee had asked how many people would benefit from the legislation the intelligence bureau repliedbut by specifically excluding muslims  and jews   the bill has raised justified concerns that the modi government is trying to enshrine religious discrimination into law this when article 14 of indias constitution prohibits discrimination on religious basiswhy does this act violate article 14?article 14 is equality of lawthe state shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of laws within the territory of india prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion  race  caste  sex or place of birththe opposition mps had pointed this out but amit shah insisted the exception to article 14  reasonable classification when making laws in simple words the state can discriminate between citizens on above grounds if special benefits are offered to them for eg  reservations for marginalised communitiesthis matter of whether reasonable classification is justified is why the act is being contended in the courts and will be decided later b  how can caa be misused?caa can be amended only by parliamentary procedures the government has said that the amendment was made to provide remedy to the six communities namely hindu  sikh  buddhist  jain  parsi or christian community from afghanistan  bangladesh or pakistan seeking shelter from religious persecution or fear of religious persecutionhowever  religious persecution is not cited anywhere in the caa  2019 the bare act readsprovided that any person belonging to hindu  sikh  buddhist  jain  parsi or christian community from afghanistan  bangladesh or pakistan  who entered into india on or before the 31st day of december  2014 and who has been exempted by the central government by or under clause  c  of subsection  2  of section 3 of the passport  entry into india  act  1920 or from the application of the provisions of the foreigners act  1946 or any rule or order made thereunder  shall not be treated as illegal migrant for the purposes of this act  religious persecution is actually mentioned under the rules to the amended passport  entry into india  act  1920this is very important to understand because the government can make changes to these rules anytime they want rules are basically subordinate laws that the central government can issue through a gazette notification at any time these laws do not require the approval of the parliamentthe above point will be important while explaining nrccredit3 what is the nrc?the national register of citizens  nrc  is a registry maintained by the government of india containing names  certain relevant information for identification of indian citizens the nationwide nrc is as a process already underway through the npr  which is proposed to be implemented in the 2021 census a  what is the npr?the npr is a list of usual residents of the country according to the ministry of home affairs  a usual resident of the country is one who has been residing in a local area for at least the last six months  or intends to stay in a particular location for the next six months unlike the nrc  the npr is not a citizenship enumeration drive  as it would record even a foreigner staying in a locality for more than six months it is mandatory for every usual resident of india to register in the nprthe npr will collect both demographic data and biometric data there are 15 different categories of demographic data  ranging from name and place of birth to education and occupation  that the rgi is supposed to collect in the npr for biometric data it will depend on aadhaar  for which it will seek aadhaar details of the residents this will allow the union government  for the first time  to connect their biometric details with information like the birthplace of their parentsapart from this  in a test run going on across the country  the rgi is seeking details of mobile number  aadhaar  pan card  driving licence  voter id card and passport  in case the resident is indian  it is also working to update the civil registration system of birth and death certificateseven as issues of privacy associated with aadhaar continue to be debated in the country  the npr is on a drive to collect detailed data on residents of india with the recent introduction of personal data protection bill  in which the centre exempts its agencies from some or all provisions of the proposed bill there are a lot of red flags being raised about misuse of such datasource b  how is npr linked to the nrc?the legal framework for the national population register is grounded in the citizenship act  1955 in 2003  the act was amended by the atal bihari vajpayeeled bjp government to introduce the category of an illegal migrant to implement this amendment  a set of rules were issued  the link to the rules is the same as 1 are caa and nrc different the rules read the central government shall  for the purpose of national register of indian citizens  cause to carry throughout the country a housetohouse enumeration for collection of specified particulars relating to each family and individual  residing in a local area including the citizenship statushow would these registers of citizens be created? the rules explicitly spell it out the local register of indian citizens shall contain details of persons after due verification made from the population registerwhen the local register is generated from the population register  a verification process would be carried out which would create the category of doubtful citizenship the final national register of citizens would be prepared by asking doubtful citizens to prove they are indians as part of a claims and objections processthis population register mentioned in the rules is nothing other than the national population registerlink in a gazette notification issued on july 31  2019  the modi government passed an order to prepare and update the population register in every state other than assamcredits for info on nprcreditcredit c  arguments against nrc i a botched exercise in assamthe national register of citizens in assam was updated over the past few years to identify undocumented migrants who had come mostly from bangladesh after 1971 the updated nrc was supposed to document all those people whose names were listed in the nrc of 1951 and were still alive as well as their living descendants who could prove they were permanent residents of the stateit was a botched exercise there were many errors during the processsource in all  around 19 lakh people in assam were excluded from the final register sourcesoon  the bjp started complaining that many undocumented immigrants had been included in the register  while around five lakh bengali hindus were excluded in fact  even some people who had campaigned for the bjp found themselves excludedsource bjp complaining about a botched nrcsource 5 lakh bengali hindus excluded in nrcsource bjp campaigners find themselves excludedanyone who is not able to prove citizenship under nrc is put in detention centresreports of the violation of human rights in these detention centres is alarmingsource a newborn died in a detention centre in assam their mother was later found not to be a foreigner ii loopholes and inconsistencies in the existing citizenship lawsthere is a lot of speculation around cut off dates and proving of ancestry based on the pilot nrc launched in assam but nothing concrete so far can be determined since the nation wide bill hasnt been draftedbut one thing we know for sure  every person resident in india will be required to prove their citizenshiphow does one prove their citizenship?this is where matters get complexif we dont consider the speculated ancestry provision which may or may not be included in the nation wide nrc  the current law for citizenship is as follows the citizenship act defines a citizen assection 3citizenship by birth  1  except as provided in subsection  2   every person born in india  a  on or after the 26th day of january  1950  but before the 1st day of july  1987  b  on or after the 1st day of july  1987  but before the commencement of the citizenship  amendment  act  2003 and either of whose parents is a citizen of india at the time of his birth  c  on or after the commencement of the citizenship  amendment  act  2003  where i  both of his parents are citizens of india  or ii  one of whose parents is a citizen of india and the other is not an illegal migrant at the time of his birth  shall be a citizen of india by birthshort of this is if you were born in india before 1987 but after 1950  you are a citizenif you were born after 1987 but before 2003 and either of your parents are indian citizens  you are a citizenif you were born after 2003 and both your parents are indian citizens or one of your parents is an indian citizen and the other is not an illegal immigrant  you are a citizenso if you were born before 1987  youre an indian citizen by birthif youre born after 1987 you have to prove that your parents are indian citizens  what about the orphans? how do you do it?if youre born before 1987  you can prove citizenship by provision of birth certificate or other documents as may be prescribed by the nrcassuming your parents were educated and organised enough they would be able to preserve your birth certificate and other such documents but people from lower middle class or slightly under privileged backgrounds may not have done the same because they werent educated and informed enough about the importance of these documents this leaves a person in a state of handicapif youre born after 1987  considering that  almost 44 of indias population is under  24 years of age and a total 85 of the population is under 54 years of age  we can safely conclude the above group constitutes a large chunk of indias populationyou have to prove that at least one of your parents is an indian citizen so if youre born after 1987 naturally your parents are born before 1987 youll have to provide the necessary documents of your parentsto prove theyre indian citizens basically they expect you to preserve and possess documents dating back to as much as the 1960smany news agencies are reporting that mere submitting of passports and aadhar cards shall suffice and this is absolutely falsemere submitting of passports  birth certificate shall not suffice to prove citizenship  this was ruled by bombay high court in 2013sourcein conclusion 67 of our population is still rural as per the 2015 census this coupled with inadequate infrastructure and lacking admin capacities to implement a nationwide program like this would be a disaster iii why nrc promotes inequality against the muslims?imagine a scenario where a nationwide npr is rolled out the babus administering the exercise mess up and end up sending a whole bunch of people  of all faiths a specified proforma from the register now  a legal recourse is available only to people of the six religions mentioned in the caa do note that the law specifically says that people belonging to these faiths shall not be treated as illegal migrants muslims  however  will not have any such recourse for that matter  even jews wont be able to do anything about their exclusion from the register as a result  lakhs and crores of excluded people might have to declare that they are illegal immigrants to become indian citizens againthe tricky part is proving religious  persecution in another countryto benefit from the caa  the person issued a specified proforma by the npr must prove that  one  they are a nonmuslim migrant from afghanistan  pakistan or bangladesh  and  two  that they came to india to escape religious persecution  read with the point mentioned in caa  but because the government can make the rules under the passport act essentially at whim  the government can simply strike out the second condition and keep only the firstcredit iv economic costthe global economy is on a slowdown and india is no exception to it  i generally never attribute gdp numbers with a government since the only active participation of a government in a gdp is via public expenditure which is still crucial however  when a government actively makes policies which are detrimental to the state of the economy  then fingers will be pointedthis is the case with nrc in assam alone it cost 1220 crores  1500 crores and ended up in a massive failuresource the national cost of implementing the nrc would run into lakhs of crores with the indian economy in its current situation  implementing nrc would surely leave a visible dent on the indian economy especially when there is absence of any roi  return on investment  from such a policythe estimated cost of this might be close to 23 lakh crores  unverified source this is an opinion piece and the figures may have the effect of being inflated or underestimatedsay  it costs 3 lakh crores  its still just 157 of our last years gdp ie 272 trillionhowever  just like demonetisation this act will bring the country to a halt people will have to line up yet again at verification centres  for document verification  follow ups  enquiries in assam  the nrc updating started on july 30  2018 and ended on august 31  2019 and despite taking over an year to complete this process  the entire process ended up in material inconsistencies and glaring errorssourcea nationwide implementation would cost years in loss of productivity and the economic cost of this practice would be dangerousdemonetisation caused the gdp growth to drop to 61  though it recovered in the later quarters and consumption patterns stabilised toosourceover 15 million jobs were lost in q3 of fy 201617 post implementation of demonetisationsource cmie reportthe nation wide implementation of nrc will have a similar or larger impact on the economy but this time it will come with a substantial human cost v cost of errorthe nrc exercise would be highly prone to errorboth type i and type ii explanationtype i errors  false positives mistakenly identifying a person as an immigrant from protected minority communities such as hindus  sikhs  buddhists  jains  parsis and christians from afghanistan  bangladesh  and pakistan  and erroneously giving them the benefit of indian citizenship immigrants are usually a net economic benefit  so the costs of type i errors are only confined to national security these costs are not nationwide and typically limited to a handful of border districts in indiatype ii errors false negativesthese occur when those who qualify as indian citizens are mistakenly categorized as illegal immigrants a nationwide nrc  if similar to the one in assam  would imply that false negatives get sent to detention centres or deportedtype ii errors are extremely costly to minimize false negatives  the bar to qualify as a citizen has to be very simple and easily identifiable also  infrastructure to scrutinize the paperwork for the nrc has to be exceptionally efficient the indian state usually fails on both counts given the cabs current religious exclusionary basis  muslims are at higher risk of exclusion through false negatives  though all groups  including hindus  are likely to be affected by errorsthere are three main issues to consider here the first is the tradeoff between type i and type ii errors if  to avoid false positives  the government has a high level of scrutiny for nrc inclusion  all individuals will have the burden of meeting this higher bar in the process  some might be mistakenly excluded on the other hand  if the bar is set very low to prevent false negatives and erroneous exclusions  then some illegal immigrants may slip through the cracks the current cab framework  combined with the nrc  is set up to minimize false positives  which will automatically increase false negativesthe third issue is of the magnitude of error1  if govt executes well with 5 error  675 million people will be displaced  equalling displacement by ww ii 2  if it has aadhaar error rate  88  120 million will be left out3  if it has 1 error  still 135 million indians will be displaced  same as partition of india both the source materials for the data above are opinion pieces since the numbers can only be estimated as of now and should be read accordinglysourcesourceplease share this with others who may find this information useful and open up discussions with supporters of the caa billhope this helped jai hindfootnoteopinion there are a lot of narratives around the caa and nrc but one thing that we need to stress on too is that illegal immigrants coming to india are disenfranchised and very poor to blanket categorise them as some evil infiltrators stealing our lands and jobs is unfair and inhumane

"did sharad pawar  ncp  congress and shiv sena just defeat bjp in the greatest game of political chess to have been played in india?after weeks of political maneuvering  backstabbing and drama that if it were made into a television series would rival game of thrones and house of cards  and were not talking about s8 got and s6 hoc   it looks like were finally getting some clarity about what is happening  what has happened and what will happen in maharashtraif you havent been following  here is what happened the people of maharashtra voted in the state elections on 21 10 2019 the primary alliances competing in the elections were the nda  made up of bjp and shiv sena  and the upa  made up of ncp and congress  bjp lost 17 seats and shiv sena lost 7 while congress gained 2 seats and the ncp gained 13 bjp got the largest share of votes but no individual party got enough seats to form a majority government  required number of seats to form a government in the maharashtra vidhan sabha is 145  after the results were declared  the shiv sena refused to form a government with the bjp because their demands for equal share in power and the post of cm for 25 years was not met the governor  a member of the bjp and rss btw   from the 8th to the 11th of november  invited the bjp  then the shiv sena and then the ncp to form the government and prove majority after all parties either refused to or failed to prove majority  presidents rule was imposed on 12th november meanwhile  the congress  ncp and the shiv sena  which has historically opposed and has been opposed by the congress and ncp and has a vastly different ideology compared to the ncp and the congress   entered into an alliance together to form the government before they could form the government though  ajit pawar  nephew of sharad pawar and his chosen representative  broke away from the ncp along with a few rebel mlas and joined hands with the bjp to form the government on 23 november  at 536 am  the governor revoked presidents rule and accepted the formation of the bjpajit pawar government  administering the oath of office to devendra fadnavis  who became the cm and entered his second term   and ajit pawar  who became deputy cm suspiciously  around this same time  all corruption charges and investigations against ajit pawar were dropped the congress  ncp and shiv sena challenged the formation of this government in the supreme court and demanded a floor test sharad pawar publicly disavowed ajit pawar and his actions the supreme court directed the new government to prove its majority by evening today today  unable to prove majority  devendra fadnavis and ajit pawar resigned and the new government was dissolvedwhat is happening  as of 1942 ist  and will happen the congress  ncp and shiv sena will form government with uddhav thackeray as the cm mlas from all three parties are in the trident hotel rn to elect uddhav as their cm ajit pawar and the rebel mlas from the ncp are back in the ncp ajit pawar will be deputy cm  edit its still left to be seen what ajit pawars fate is but the process of reconciliation seems to have already started  the terms of the power sharing  afaik  are still unknown but will most probably be that shiv sena and ncp will hold the cm post for 25 years each with the congress will play a supporting role  with all three parties sharing equal power edit what follows is speculation from my side but imo it is very probable that this might have happened  now all this might seem like a crazy series of events  but i cant help but feel that all events  after the shiv sena entered into an alliance with the ncp and congress  have been carefully orchestrated by all three parties and especially sharad pawar  who i believe has shown amit shah that shah is still a diaperwearing amateur at a game that pawar is a veteran of sharad pawar and co have managed to split the senabjp alliance although the alliance was always rocky  pawar and co have managed to split a natural alliance of the bjp and shiv sena that was borne out of a shared hindutva idealogy  while simultaneously managing to form an alliance with their bitter rivals prevent bjp from forming the government now this seems super obvious  but its very impressive considering the fact that bjp netted the most amount of votes in the election exposed the hypocrisy of the bjp bjp has always run on a platform that stated that their party and government were not corrupt  unlike the opposition who has had multiple huge corruption scandals it was one of the major reasons why they won in 2014 now  after the saga with ajit pawar  who  lets face it  was never seriously splitting with the ncp  and all this was just a ploy   sharad pawar has managed to expose the corrupt nature of the bjp in a very public manner saved ajit pawar from jail this is the cherry on top for pawar and co and possibly the most stinging thing to happen to the bjp during this whole saga pawar has not just managed to expose the corruption of the bjp but also managed to save his nephew from the consequences of corruption using his enemy as the deliverer tool of salvationnow all this is great and dandy for pawar  ncp  shiv sena and the congress but what does it mean for us observers and the voters of maharashtra? well these are the conclusions i ended up on after this whole saga democracy is dead im sure all the voters who voted for shiv sena because they wanted the bjp in power and all the voters who voted for ncp and congress because they did not want the shiv sena in power are feeling duped  betrayed and angry rn  and they have a very good reason to be if  ultimately  the choice of a population does not even matter  what point is there to democracy? what point is there to voting? might as well choose the next government based on who is better at jenga or monopoly  sharad pawar  uddhav thackeray  devendra fadnavis or balasaheb thorat integrity  ideology and principles dont matter all that matters now is power yeah the congress  ncp and shiv sena have managed to defeat the bjp but at what cost? all parties involved have betrayed the core principles and ideas upon which their parties were found by entering into this alliance why even have separate parties then?  voters dont matter all 3 parties have betrayed the trust that their voters and supporters placed in them meanwhile the bjp has betrayed the trust that the general public lays on institutions and figures like the governor who are supposed to be neutralsharad pawar and co might have just managed to win the greatest game of political chess to have been played in india but it is the rest of us common folk who have lost regardless of which political ideology you believe in or which party you support  i hope you can agree when i say that this entire saga was a dark period for democracy in indiaedit we still cant say for sure if this whole ajit pawar saga was a carefully constructed ploy or if he actually betrayed  he is know to make rash decisions  sharad pawar he wasnt present at the joint press conference of the parties where uddhav thackeray was announced as the cm and some ncp members asked sharad pawar to ensure that ajit pawar is back in the fold asap so its still unclear but i can definitely say for sure that whether this was by intention or not  it has only helped the ncpshiv senacongress alliance as someone who doesnt follow politics thank you for summarising everything that has happened i was so confused wtf was going on all this time appreciate the effort in this post hardly the greatest  but yesfor once  shah was defeated at his own game no less whatever has happened has for the good1 shivsena is no longer hindutva party  it has entered into its third phase  1st  may marathi bhoomiputra  2nd  hindutva  3rd  cosmopolitan mumbaiyya with shades of sons of soil politics gives it a lot of space to maneuver2 ncp + shivsena + congress is going to be a formidable coalition however  there might be issues when they fight the next election  but that is something way in the future 3 bjp is on backfoot  but it has room to grow it is no longer restricted by shivsena in terms of seat sharing but it will never get a majority of its own tough task ahead especially after string of losses in various states it can think of venturing into new territories like odisha bengal but those arent a sure shot it might even lose jharkhand4 this also brings an end  somewhat  to ideological fights there are only 2 left  bjp and antibjp5 ideology ka dhong band karna chahiye every party craves power that is their only ideology thanks for this detailed breakdown as an nri i cant really seem to trust mainstream news completely because almost every one of them has an agenda or are paid by politicians  i would give you silver if i had the coins here is some fake silver  people like pawar  devegowda  lallu n the next level like bsy  siddu  dkshi etc  sorry for quoting on ka names  but i am sure there are others too  are very well versed with how to play the game unlike the pseudo chanakyas who only know the language of threat  temptation of money not always can one win by misusing power is what is being proven yet again here  democracy is dead #x200b people do not vote for parties though  ideally by design  they vote for individual representatives thats why i am against the party system  after the results were declared  the shiv sena refused to form a government with the bjp because their demands for equal share in power and the post of cm for 25 years was not meti disagree with this we do not know if bjp promised the cm post or no hence cant just decide ss is the one to blame for their alliance falling apart though of course that has become or been made the popular narrativeand this doesnt seem like sp pulling a fast one on the bjp but the bjp committing suicide they won the electionwhen ss refused to play second fiddle all they had to do was play the victim card and claim the moral high ground when the state went to reelection they would have the narrative in their favourwhat i think has happened is that fadnavis tried to assert himself and bit off more than he could chew he assured delhi he would get the bjp a majority on its own which is why i think they probably did promise ss the cm seat on rotation basis so there would be no splitting of votes  intending to backstab them when they had won a simple majority on their own they didnt and that made his position vulnerable he has enemies within the state bjp  and doesnt get along with nitin gadkari he had to do something then this drama played out whether he tried to poach ncp mlas or pawar played him  this whole thing happened because of bjps and fadnavis arrogance fadnavis owes his position to shahmodi the duo needed him to stay in power so they could influence the state which has traditionally not had good relations with outsiders and gujaratis in particular due to the splitting of bombay state and he needed them to remain in power against gadkaris faction   how a tug of war between fadnavis and gadkari results in maharashtra stalemate   https  wwwcnbctv18com politics howatugofwarbetweenfadnavisandgadkariresultsinmaharashtrastalemate4663851htm  maharashtra politics are efforts on to edge out devendra fadnavis?  https  wwwthehindubusinesslinecom news national maharashtrapoliticsareeffortsontoedgeoutdevendrafadnavis article29896758ece   ajit pawar and the rebel mlas from the ncp are back in the ncp ajit pawar will be deputy cmlmao #whaat the game has just begun the same happened in karnataka  but look who is in power now its a battle for survival for shiv sena  and pawar helped it isnt going to mean anything more to ncp than having a share in the power of this government but for shiv sena  this means everything balasaheb was the man hypothetically  if he comes back  demands that sena workers bring him the heads of every sena mla right now  their party cadres would do this in 20 minutes not going into the character  ideology of balasaheb   good  bad  ugly  but this was his pull even bjp knew they cant mess with him they accepted being the lesser power out of two after balasaheb  bjp realized they could be bigger partner and  sena saw the ground slipping they only have maharashtra  bjp has the whole country if they let them become the senior partner  why would sena survive 10 years from now in battle of survival  you befriend the devils you hate a bhakt told me that fadnavis got into cm chair and the first thing he did was to clear some farmer relief fund turned out to be truebut yeah  i still think that was a shit display by all parties more entertaining than any hbo or netflix series  democracy is deadim pretty sure indian democracy exceeds the lives allotted to a cat every week  given the number of times its been pronounced dead its fun to make strong  hyperbolic statements innitthe mandate was for bjp + ss the _+_ there didnt work out  so the govt will now by lead by 3 parties with a combined 48 of the vote sharewas that really the mandate? sure  nohave all of them proven to be greedy pigs? sure  yesis it bad for mh? will we see return of blatant lowlevel corruption  and kneejerk cancellation of bjps pet infra projects? probablywill the effects of this political game play out in the next election? itd be stupid to expect bjp to not revise their alliance arrangements wrt shiv senaultimately  do the coalition parties represent the largest share of the coalition mandate at 48 of the total votes? if im adding 16  16  and 16 correctly  im gonna hazard a guess and say yes? these games dont matter what matters is keeping the alliance together this is the closest we have seen to a successful implementation of the fabled mahagathbandan making the ghatbandan work in maharashtra will go a long way to proving its feasibility for the voters these three parties need to keep that in mind  play the long game  and focus on delivering results for the people will solve a lot of their problems  all at once well written postthis is no victory  but a remarkable resistance of ruthless poweri think that this scenario is similar to what we saw in karnataka fractured mandate  bjp biased governor hurriedly installs a bjp cm opponents unite  run the government for few years  bjp uses central investigation agencies to go after corrupt opponents  government falls  mlas migrate to bjp out of fear or opportunity  bjp comes back to powerunless aap becomes strong  there is no stopping bjp in the long run this is truly scary  worse scenario pawar has dealt the death blow to modishah combine their air of invincibility has been broken modi is not gonna take this loss kindly the antishah voices in bjp and rss are gonna be fanned shah is vulnerable and the vultures are circling overhead all corruption charges and investigations against ajit pawar were droppedthis one is not correct though acb has released a statement saying that some open enquiries have been closed against ajit pawar  and none of them have anything to do with the irrigation scam he has around 40 cases against him apparently appreciate the effort to articulate the saga entirely  though great job excellent summary thank you  democracy is deadhold on to these grandiloquent pronouncements  shiv sena and bjp are living off the hindutva votebank and they appeal to the same class of voters if both of them were to contest elections separately  the hindutva votebank will split and none of them will win so  their alliance was a convenience to let both parties remain relevant dishonouring prepoll alliance is not against the constitution  so  technically democracy is not dead  yet what pawar did1 first gets shiv sena to stick to 5050 formula until alliance collapses2  then he gets shiv sena to quit nda3  then he gets bjp to drop cases against ajit pawar4  then he forces ajit to quit  fadnavis to quit twice within 2 weekspawar ensured thata   bjp have egg on their faceb   get accused of subverting democratic normsc   besmirched reputations of the highest constitutional offices it is indeed greatest game ever played pawar should open a school where politics chanakya niti is taught", "tokenized": [101, 2106, 21146, 12173, 22195, 2906, 13316, 2361, 3519, 1998, 11895, 2615, 12411, 2050,

indian businesses and a controversial boxing championship have in common?both reflect a world in which power and economics drive policy  politics and business at the expense of fundamental rightsand both underscore an emerging new world order in which might is right  a jungle in which dissenters  minorities and all other others are increasingly cornered and repressedrather than furthering stability by building inclusive  cohesive societies both support trends likely to produce an evermore unstable and insecure world marked by societal strife  mass migration  radicalization and violencea world in which business capitalizes on decisions by a critical mass of world leaders who share autocratic  authoritarian and illiberal principles of governance and often reward each other with lucrative business deals for policies that potentially aggravate rather than reduce conflictno doubt  the planned acquisition by saudi arabias stateowned national oil company aramco of 20 percent of the petroleumrelated businesses of reliance industries  one of indias biggest companies  makes commercial and strategic economic and business senseyet  there is equally little doubt that the announcement of the acquisition will be read by indian prime minister narendra modi  days after he scrapped the autonomous status of the troubled  majority muslim region of kashmir  as a license to pursue his hindu nationalist policies that discriminate against muslims and other minorities and fuel tensions with pakistan  the subcontinents other nuclear powerthe ultimate cost of the fallout of policies and business deals that contribute or give license to exclusion rather than inclusion of all segments of a population and aggravate regional conflict could be far higher than the benefits accrued by the parties to a dealunderscoring the risk of exclusionary policies and unilateral moves  cross border skirmishes between indian and pakistani forces erupted this week along the kashmiri frontier in which at least five people were killedthe timing of the announcement of the aramco reliance deal in a global environment in which various forms of racism and prejudice  including islamophobia  are on the rise  assures indian political and business leaders that they are unlikely to pay an immediate price for policies that sow discord and risk loss of lifelike in the case of saudi and muslim acquiescence in chinas brutal clampdown on turkic muslims in the troubled  northwestern chinese province of xinjiang  the most frontal assault on a faith in recent history  the announcement risks convincing embattled muslim minorities like the uighurs  the kashmiris or myanmars rohingya who are lingering in refugee camps in bangladesh that they are being hung out to dryto be sure  kashmiris can count on the support of pakistan but that is likely to be little more than emotional  verbal and politicalpakistan is unlikely to risk blacklisting by the financial action task force  fatf   an international antimoney laundering and terrorism finance watchdog  at its next scheduled meeting in october by unleashing its antiindian militantsanthony joshuas controversial fight with andy ruiz scheduled for december in saudi arabia  the first boxing championship to be held in the middle east  pales in terms of its geopolitical or societal impact compared to the saudi indian business dealfact is that saudi arabias hosting of the championship has provoked the ire of activists rather than significant population groups the fight is furthermore likely to be seen as evidence and a strengthening of crown prince mohammed bin salmans selective efforts to socially liberalize the once austere kingdomnonetheless  it also reinforces prince mohammeds justified perception that saudi arabia can get away with imprisoning activists who argued in favour of his reforms as well as the lack of transparency on judicial proceedings against the alleged perpetrators of the killing of journalist jamal khashoggi in the saudi consulate in istanbul saudi arabia insists the killing was perpetrated by rogue operativeswhat saudi investment in india and the scheduled boxing championship in the kingdom have in common is that both confirm the norms of a world in which humane authority  a concept developed by prominent chinese international relations scholar yan xuetong  is a rare quantitymr yan employs the concept to argue without referring to president xi jinping  xinjiang  chinas aggressive approach towards the south china sea or its policy towards taiwan and hong kong that china lacks the humane authority to capitalize on us president donald j trumps undermining of us leadershipmr yan defines a state that has humane authority as maintaining strategic credibility and defending the international order by becoming an example through adherence to international norms  rewarding states that live up to those norms and punishing states that violate them garnering humane authority enables a state to win allies and build a stable international ordermr yans analysis is as applicable to india and saudi arabia as it is to china and others that tend towards civilizational policies like the united states  russia  hungary and turkeyit is equally true for men like anthony joshua promoter eddie hearn and business leaders in generalto be sure  aramco is stateowned and subject to government policy nonetheless  as it prepares for what is likely to be the worlds largest initial public offering  even aramco has to take factors beyond pure economic and financial criteria into accountat the end of the day  the consequence of mr yans theory is that leadership  whether geopolitical  economic or business  is defined as much by power and opportunity as it is by degrees of morality and ethicsfailure to embrace some notion of humane authority and reducing leadership and business decisions to exploiting opportunity with disregard for consequences or the environment in which they are taken is likely to ultimately haunt political and business leaders alikesaid mr yan since the leadership of a humane authority is able to rectify those states that disturb the international order  the order based on its leadership can durably be maintainedwhat is true for political leaders is also true for business leaders even if they refuse to acknowledge that their decisions have as much political as economic impactdr james m dorsey is a senior fellow at nanyang technological universitys s rajaratnam school of international studies  an adjunct senior

commercial work a hospitality group can afford a decent budget  but a small business type independent restaurant will be much more price consciousif you are new to food photography  my suggestion to you would be to be upfront and tell them you havent done this professionally  which is why you will work with them on pricing  so its fair for both parties also drop your regular rates in this conversation to anchor a price point  so that you dont get low balledyou make your mark in this specialization and charge big ticket prices and you will still get booked  but until that day you do what you need to reach that level play the long game  money will comeedit just saw you wrote zomato  swiggy quote high and wait for counter offer if they accept without a counter  your quote was too low i got in touch with a third party company in chennai that wanted photogs to go around and take pics for swiggy in chennai   they pay was 350 bucks per restaurant and  i had to shoot 3 restaurants a day along with 14 or more pics per restaurant  that amounted to 1050 bucks a day and that doesnt even cover the cost of a days rental for my camera  so i politely told them to fuck off",

adoortakesadigatftiidirectorseminence 2015 06 22 article2879628ece i understand when a new govt comes to power it appoints its own people to the govt offices when upa came to power in 2004  it replaced most of the state governers with its own sympathizers now that bjp has come to power  it did the same thing except mr najib jung fair enough and pretty much consistentbut one thing i dont get is why is bjp appointing unqualified people in the institutions of national importance? how does it serve any purpose? isnt it against the very philosophy of make in india? if you want india to develop  you need to have qualified guardians at the institutions of national importancei understand that india academia is highly influences by leftist ideology which i personally despise im libertarian  procapitalism when it comes to economic ideology bjp is far right wing which has procapitalism as economic philosophy at its core but how do recent appointments justify it? if right wing is about market capitalism  should not bjp give more autonomy to these institutions  instead of screwing up their reputation with highhanded appointmentsi understand top brass of bjp rss feel that curricula of indian education system is against indian culture traditions they also feel that history subject is biased but if they want to change it  shouldnt they do it at the school level anyway institutions like iit tifr iissc iims are mostly about science  technology  technology so  why messing with them?india already doesnt have any univ in the top 300 ranking of qs world ranking with recent highhanded appointments  im sure their quality will take a nosedivethis is pretty much my thoughts let us please discuss it i would request people not to take sides please be objective in your analysis based on logic its not about bjp congress aap its about me and your futureedit what the hell seems  downvoting brigade is already activated cmon yaar  it took me a lot efforts to dig all the relevant info  i would request you not to downvote it please leave this thread if you dont wanna participate off topic  but i should probably avoid trying for ftii next year? i dont know about ftii as far as research institutes go  there is a bit of laxity and there is no direction in research most scientists just want to publish papers  and i am not  trying to undermine the importance of publishing papers or basic research  but there has to be a goal of developing technology product which aligns with national policy and interests isro is a good example when a research institute is in alignment with national interests and policy this example is probably a little simplistic because in institutes like iit iisc ncl etc it is harder to define goals and even harder to achieve these goalsto develop a technology which is applicable in the real world  it takes a lot of time and effort and in addition almost every new technology takes a multidisciplinary approach to develop from my experience the indian research institutes lack severely in the latterthere are several other problems as well  but be assured appointment of a member of board of director or even director of an institute will not affect the quality  existing  of research in the institute and the low world rankings are mostly because of lack of infrastructure and lopsided faculty student ratio  deleted   anyway institutions like iit tifr iissc iims are mostly about science  technology  technology so  why messing with them?  because they have failed at their primary goals? negligible research output  unimpressive pedagogy and a vision that is missing in action a bit of a shakeup at the top wont hurt ftii on the other hand deserved better than sri gajendra  what the hell seems  downvoting brigade is already activatedparty before country  rightwingers definition of nationalism  kids have come to power after 60 years    dont worry next elections they are gonna loose for sure and every state elections from now on  ftii  and indian film making in general  is as shitty as it can getpeople say gajendra chouhan is not qualified to be ftii chief i say ftii is so shitty  even a random 40 year old with some life experience can only improve it the one condition is that he she should not come from ftii  or indian mainstream filmmaking  which is just pure horseshit   how is ftii and institution of national importance?second question  why should government be in the business of running ftii but one thing i dont get is why is bjp appointing unqualified people in the institutions of national importance?you have one data point for this  op  just one correction bjp is not far right in the generally accepted spectrum if anything they would be considered left of centre economically

coughing  sneezing  and dmart staff advising them to take their supplies and leave fast i think we may  have reached stage 3 and supermarkets are new hotbeds for covid19 i think now would be a good time to go back to pre mart era practices a single window dispensing the items you prebook whatever you need and pick it up at scheduled time of course this would be easier for smaller towns and villages but with proper coordination and management it can be done in bigger cities as well things would not be as bad of the authorities did not prevent you from moving out to get your stuff like they are doing now is buying a weeks ration for family of 4 hoarding? this isnt hoarding the current recommendation in a lot of countries is to buy a weeks grocery at a time  so you dont ha e to leave home any more often than that if you think about how much a joint family goes through in a week  it might seem like hoarding  but its actually the recommended strategy i think the whole idea about hoarding is that you dont have to get out of your house anytime soon  so that you can have your supplies stocked up  but yes youre right it is probably the new hotbet for the virus better to buy from the friendly neighborhood baniya for this same reason iam avoiding going to crowded or popular supermarket  going to lesser known or less crowded seems better and they have a lot items available due to less coming to them theres no clarity when and how the lockdown will end there are no assurances from government and in times of opaque information flow  chaos will ensue i think taking as much as you can store and keep is a good idea it minimizes the number of times you need to go out and reduces the risk of your own exposure  your familys exposure and the chances of you spreading to others in case youre an asymptomatic carrieryoure going to use it over the next week or two weeks anyways  as long as you dont let it spoil  so it evens out youre not depriving anyone  youre reducing chances of

if only the applicant is allowed to pay the visa fees by cic clarify this with the company before accepting the offerf it is very difficult to adjust with cold weather of st john due to health issue related to weather  if we are not able to stay there after 23 months than how bond will be executed???i dont think companies have bonds in canada you can usually leave work in 24 weeks notice  as per terms of employment  and companies can do the same  they can let you go with the same notice id recommend starting in summer so it is easier for you to adopt to the weather i will have to leave my social life  family life  business and some notional benefits too what can be the advantage of canada if i accept the offerbenefits  u das_halifax did a good job summarizing are any specialised engineering study institutes universities being there for part time study??not sure if you dont find much  let me know and ill do some research for you is the no objection certificate from wife is required as a part of process if proceeding alone for few months??? or they demand it as extra security??absolutely not no noc required from your jobs wife for you to go my son is studying in 10th standard is it advisable to complete study up to 12th in india or he should study there? best bit for you is your son is in a perfect age to hit a jackpot as i said  i was 16 when we immigrated best thing is that indian high school system is rigorous while in canada  high school is a breeze  comparatively   while universities are a significant jump in difficulty at your sons age  he will get a significant advantage as he would already know much of the content in maths and science that is taught here in grade 11 and 12 but he has to grab the opportunity as well if i were in india  the best i would have thought of was ld college of engineering  or ms university of baroda  yet i was able to do engineering from university of toronto  which is better than any iit keep in mind that he has to grab the opportunity i had plenty of indian friends  but almost none of them took the opportunity i had done 11th standard in india  and had to do 11th and 12th again here if your son studied in gujarati medium  he might have to work hard initially i was in english medium if he studies all the way until 12th in india  a downside is that now canadian universities dont know how he measures up against local applicants  and now he might be competing against international applicants so  better if he is part of canadian high school system before 12th  he will likely have to give ielts  academic module  toefl regardless  btw  is indian food available in stjohn nb???every small town in canada has it but no guarantees that youll like the taste often  indian restaurants in remote towns cater to taste buds of white people than indians a tradeoff of not living in toronto  i guess are there any other provisions to get the p r earlier??try express entry check  crs tool  http  wwwcicgcca english immigrate skilled crstoolasp  and see how much you score as of oct 2018  people with score of 442 were granted pr 12 my elder son is of 22 years how can i sponsor him other than student visa?please dont go for student visa you have the right thinking people come here with admission in any random college in canada  college  diploma  university  degree if he has done bachelors  and working  best bet is for him to get 23 years of experience and apply through express entry  try crs tool for him as well  i know someone who immigrated recently at age of 25 and is doing pretty good pr from day 1 and none of the struggles that people who come on student visa go throughi dont think you can sponsor him he has to apply by himself as he is already 21 he may get additional points if you are a pr citizen  but not sure youll have to confirm with the crs link above my ultimate goal is to settle in canada with family in pleasant weather province please suggest place or another possible sourcespleasant weather? vancouver but it also rains a lot in vancouver in summer still better than having snow in other parts of canada though vancouver is crazy expensive to live in though  because of chinese black money in real estate second  id put toronto less snow than other parts of canada  and even cities like ottawa  montreal toronto is expensive as well  but toronto suburbs should work out wellconcluding thoughts it is a big change to move at age of 50 as you said  you are resetting your social  family life  and business at this point  you are moving for the sake of your son than yourself if it was just you and kaki  i wouldnt recommend immigrating please consider the fact that you are also subjecting your wife to a completely new environment  with no relatives around there are a few gujaratis in nb now  moncton  fredericton etc  but most are international students  so not sure how youd relate call me emotional  but it still haunts me that my future generations wont be able to communicate with me in gujarati if i remain in canada the rest of my life not that they wont know how to  but they wont be comfortable in 23 generations  the language will be wiped out from your family also  same thing about good values that might be unique to india i am still not at peace with this  and am planning on returning back in a couple of yearspm me if youd like to discuss more we can chat over whatsapp if youd like you make the decision  but i can make you aware of all the realities based on the experience iv gathered here in more than a decade  and that might help you make the decision your salary is quite low man  even for nb since you are going with a teenage son  who will enter college  your wife will have to work otherwise you wont be happy at all incredibly paltry salary  and there are very few opportunities available in st johns for getting higher salary than this that place has very high unemployment rate sort this aspect out  rest everything will fall in place  id advice you to post this in r canada and r abcd as well you might get better answers there having traveled to both countries  100000 times yes 50 is 25 in canada you are quite the young man  sir good luck r iwantout what are you waiting for? as long as you have done homework on validating the pr in 6 months claim  what do you have to lose?  stay there for 5 to 7 years  become a citizen  get your son a decent shot at life in canada and if you dont like it go back you have worked till 50 and obviously ahmedabad has not given you what you are looking for otherwise  you would not be thinking about leaving at this stage of life as someone who left india at the age of 17  trust me when i say you will be giving your son the biggest gift any parent can give a child a gift of choice i say go ahead and dont look back negotiate everything but dont look back  bhaiyya kitni baar bahar gaye ho? culture shock na ho jaye kahi sare aam chumma chaati karte logo ko dekh karand the society there is different so be prepared that indian way of thinking needs to be changed weather will be extremely cold compared to gujarat  its not worth it you shall suffer from the lack of food  a familiar natural environment  social life et cetera really not a good decision", "tokenized": [101, 2003, 2009, 4276, 3048, 2000, 2710, 2006, 1996, 3978, 1997, 3105, 4495, 2012, 1996, 2287, 1997,

lockdown in india?i can feel it in my bones if nations with far advanced public and health infrastructures  like italy  south korea  japan  and iran are rapidly moving towards a state of emergency  italy has gone into total lockdown as of this morning  then indians are sitting ducks for reasons you probably know better than me i dont want to raise panic  but i want to quietly prepare for the possibility of a massive outbreak how should i go about stockpiling food? frozen food and canned food are out of options as my region already gets frequent and overlong power cuts on normal days and the latter isnt readily available what items would you stock on thatd have a long shelf life?    obviously talking about the appalling state of government hospitals in india and the general doctor to patient ratio indian food is easiest to stock buy rice  flour  pulses  potatoes etc umm  there wont be a lockout in india if it breaks through  it breaks through the virus has a very high infection rate and comparatively  low mortality rate so  by the time the government realizes that this has gone out of hand  it will be irretrievably out of hand  lockout will cost more lives than the virus

but all of them are more crowded than any normal day  people are climbing on roof of the buses  thousands pf men women children are on the streets crowd management is total failure there the rich brought the virus to our soil  and the poor are the ones that sufferwhile people i know are trying to figure out where theyd get their next packet of cigarettes from  migrant workers are on the streets breaking down on the sight of food to eat  and a clean bottle of wateri feel so helpless that i cant physically do more than just rant on the internet i hate this feeling fuck i wasnt ready for thiscant imagine the trauma 1000s are going through away fron their families with no food or shelterreally puts things in perspective when you see such thingshow can the government choose to ignore this empathy nahi hai saalo meinhindu muslim right left doesnt matter humanity should come first  deleted  those arent tears of gratitude please dont mistake them for that sure  there is some gratitude behind them  but know this behind every tear the poor shed  there is restrained anger  hidden shame  wounded pride every one of those tears is telling them that this is no way of living  only to have to live like that for many  many days to come someone will come who will weaponize those emotions and no tyrant will be able to stand against them for now  all we can do is hope that such a day will come im kinda torn about this on the one hand i see the importance of letting the country know how bad the situation has become on the other  i think taking a  video of this man crying steals the few shreds of dignity he has left yaar koi reliable ngo organisation doing something about this? how can we help? source  https  twittercom aaqibrk status 1243594510480707585?s19 and here i am sitting at my home complaining over small things  seeing this video made me think how undeserving i am  this man probably busts his ass all day providing for his family and thats a normal day i can even begin to imagine what so many people are going through  its as if we are all on a ship and they have been left in the cold dark sea  just with a floater i pray they get through this and the people helping them are absolute heroes wish they reach home soon we have failed as a society imagine being recorded while you shed tears of pain man this really puts things into perspective how life can be difficult  unforgiving at one moment you leave for a city far away with dreams  ambition and hope and at another all of that is taken from you  more people are going to suffer due to the unemployed caused by coronavirus than coronavirus itself this is sad very sad i lost my sadism and sarcasm looking at this i am serious i never feel so helpless upon seeing these people no one deserve to face such i couldnt control my tears still thinking why corona virus has revealed real  terrible holes in our system we have an economy that heavily relies on efforts of exactly those who used up and chewed out and treated like dirtif we learn anything from this crises  let it be the fact that our neoliberal  capitalist society has time and time again failed vast majority of its participants because of lack of humanity of the process we need to wake up or this becomes a new normal good to see people are coming forward while it wont do a lot  it is a good place to start the most shocking part is that some people are blaming these poor folks for the situation they also applaud each time they see police brutality in the name of this lockdown empathy is pretty much dead i think in india ok  i get it it is emotional but dont zoom in when someone is breaking downgive them some privacy in spite of being a huge critic of modi  i appreciated the decision of lockdown he took but at that point of time  i didnt consider the situation of these workers of course  he has a team of specialists so they must have known what is gonna happen regarding this so i dont understand why they couldnt

innocent  my own relative from my moms side was tortured  he still suffers from ptsd and nerve disorders today after losing to cpm at the start of their 33 year old rule on bengal  only the young and rising youth congress leader mamata banerjee kept them relevant in the state until she got fed up with the party central command and left to create tmc in 1997 so for 20+ years congress is the most

the rest of this post so credit to him for these partsthe communists arrived with the promise of giving farmers and labourers their dues strong trade unions were formed to fight for their rights industrialists were pressured to increase wages and provide better working conditionsbut unfortunately  this just made the situation worse the industrialists had no money to do all that  already their businesses were suffering as a result  hartals  lockdowns  strikes  most of the industries that had survived were forced to shut shop due to labour unrest and you had hundreds and thousands of people without any jobs  quite often these jobless youths were employed by the communist party as their cadres  leading to the very strong grassroots cadrebased politics of west bengal  still surviving today by the time the government realised their mistake  it was too late no industrialist would even come near bengal given the history of labour unrest this also coincided with the manmohan singh led economic reforms of the central government  which opened up india to foreign investors these investors came and set shop in other states  who would want to do business in a communist state?when jyoti basu retired  the new brigade of cpi m  decided they had to do something to stop the rot again  their efforts backfired they tried too hard to reassure industrialists to invest in bengal  leading to nandigram and singur unrests  both were cases where the government tried to take land forcibly from the farmers and hand it to industries  singur agitation ran from late 2005 early 2006  peaking in late 2006 with the tapasi mallik rape and murder case  my first taste of student politics happened at this time when about 20 of us did a sitin to protest and the first time i was detained by police  in my first year of college   nandigram agitation reached its peak with police firing on protesters on 14th march 2007this outraged all bengalis in 2009 lok sabha elections  the left front tally in wb went down from 35 to 15 then in 2011 assembly elections  left front which had won 233 out of 294 seats in 2006  could manage only 62 in a strange irony  the communist government was defeated resoundingly for the mistake of taking land from peasants and selling it to private industrialistsso ya  cpm hasnt changed one bit since 2011 the moment they come to power  they will start selling off fertile farm land at basically free prices to industrialists again  ruining farmers again personally  i hope cpm just dies ###dilip ghosh  bjpobviously he comes from the genocidal  muslim hating

1993  when mamata banerjee  then state president of indian youth congress  the youth wing of the indian national congress in west bengal  organised a protest march to writers building  the seat of then communistled government of west bengal they demanded voter photoid cards be made mandatory to ensure free and fair polling however  around 11 am  one kilometre before the building  they were intervened by the state police  near metro cinema on mayo road and dorina road crossing at esplanade the police fired at them  resulting in the death of 13 people and several injuriesshe took a bullet to the stomach for protesting for something rightful on the orders of then cm jyoti basuher 26 day fast protesting against the cpm on the singur incident was also very important so  tmc came to power and mamata became the cm 9 years ago unfortunately 9 years is too short a time to right what happened over the past 60 yearshas she done everything she could to better bengals economy? no  she hasnt but she has tried for the first few years it seemed we were going back to 70s and 80s with a lot of promises made but nothing happening on ground but over the years  her effort has shown one of the major things she did right was to appoint some good capable professionals and politicians to important ministries like finance  industries  labour  agriculture  urban development and filling the rest with chamchas and career politicians as a result  economy  civic planning  tourism etc has seen excellent development in the past decade the biggest thing for me that i have seen is the patient planning  and the setting up of grounds before moving in with a major policyanother thing that gets lost in the minority appeasement rhetoric is the work that has been done for the tribals and indigenous peopleshe has also done excellent work for social welfare  especially for girls her kanyashree project  scholarship to girls from poor families  as long as they are not forcefully married before they are 18  and as long as they attend schools  along with a one time grant of 25000 rupees when the girl turns 18  has done wonders in bengal it has reduced child marriage and increased literacy amongst girls from backward communities in one go this scheme was even recognised by united nations as the best social development scheme in the developing world people dont talk enough about kanyashree  it is one of the best things to happen in bengal in my lifetimeis bengal doing great today? no  not at all theres still loads of problems that need to be addressedhas her rule been clean and corruption free? absolutely notis bengal free from political violence? again  nohas she done enough? probably notbut we are heading towards the right direction  albeit slowly bengal is not going to be prosperous overnight  there are loads and loads of issues  and she has successfully tackled quite a few of themoverall  i would say she has done more good than harm  which is not something you can say about most governments in indianote  kanyashree scheme for girls in bengal wins un award   https  wwwndtvcom indianews kanyashreeschemeforgirlsinbengalwinsunaward1716321 i actually believe mamata banerjee is amongst the best 2 cms of the state of all time after dr bidhan chandra ray every one else did far more harm for the state than goodalso  as seen above  she is the least evil of the 4 choices and she is clearly not a genocidal maniac like your beloved modi no genocidal maniac takes a bullet for whats rightas such  i am a fan of her even if she has done some questionable and bad things###ps what i left outhttps  economictimesindiatimescom news elections loksabha india whatmakesbengalpoliticssodifferentfromtherestofindia articleshow 68826757cms?frommdr its called syndicatein short after the partitions  the local panchayets and whats was left of zamindars along with some local muscles teamed up to form a power structure that dictated everything that happens locally they decided everything of their local area this system spread through out the stateafter bidhan chandra ray died  bangla congress  then named branch of bengal inc  basically took the leaders of such groups under their own party banner some of them were even given party tickets and actually  officially became leaders of their said areasjust before cpm came in power in 77  majority of these groups switched sides to cpm and became cpm cadres as they were called  note cpm actually actively discouraged caste politics and encouraged class politics and made these groups follow it  which is why caste politics is not prevalent in bengal despite heavy casteism same said groups switched sides to tmc in 2011 before they won and then they came to be known as syndicateits very much clear that whichever party holds these tiny power groups are actually able to become the state rulers unfortunately 9 years is too short a time to right what happened over the past 60 yearssame excuse the bhakths giving for modii like your interesting take on mamata where youve conveniently ignored the following1 corruption  only mamata bhakths believe that she and her party members had nothing to do with the sarada scam or the other chit funds the cases are still pending and the money is totally gone whatever money was returned to the few was taken out from the state funds a bridge collapsed in the middle of city and tmc government didnt bat an eye trifala scam has started again theres too many to list here  but do check what abhishek banerjee has been doing for the last few years 2 intolerance  calling students maoists and arresting them arresting professors and putting them behind bars without fair trial for posting a simple meme police violence in ju torturing civil service officers to suicide 3 lies and jumla  park street rape case the accused escaped and his gf who aided his escape was taken into the party mamata assassinated the character of the rape victim just to give a clean chit to the accused everyone forgot that it seems in this regard  care to elaborate whats shes doing with the covid 19 testing to hide the numbers? social media is rife with tells of how people are being turned away from hospitals  and thats not bjp propaganda im receiving news from my friends who are doctors that theres state sponsored propaganda to hide the numbers mamata even went as far to forcefully audit the deaths to comorbid conditions so that the covid report can be suppressed funny thing is  unless theres comorbid conditions  youll not even die from covid  that doesnt mean its not spreading4 industrial output  pray tell what mamata has done to improve the states industrial output? where are the jobs? weve all been hearing the empty lies from the biswa bangla summit  how many of the those projects ever came to fruition?5 minority appeasement  while modi is trying to get rid of muslims  mamata is doing the opposite  going as far as to ignore the criminal elements in the society to pander to that votebank the attack on doctors that sparked a protest across the country was fueled by the simple fact that mamata didnt have the guts to arrest the criminals because they were muslims  even when the rational bengali muslim community tried denouncing them over and over she has given the statement that those who came from bangladesh and have voted are now citizens even if they have come recently  what the fuck? mamata doesnt get to decide who gets citizenship we dont want bangladeshis here  no matter if they are hindu or muslim her government had even shielded war crime convicts just to get some brownie points why?theres no difference between modi and mamata except the fact that while the first one is trying to get rid of the muslims  the second one was trying to alleviate them to a godlike status  one imam from a bengali masjid gave the statement a few years ago that the muslims will decide who gets to become the cm of wb  other than that  the lies and jumla are just as widespread  the corruption just as deep the only reason mamata gets away with all this is because bengal has became irrelevant in the national stage no one gives a shit else shes just as corrupt and authoritarian as modi and if talking about the developments  these are all being done with a single strategy destroy bengals industrial output  evict all the educated folks  so whoever left becomes solely dependant on the state for their livelihood meanwhile she and her goons can continue ruling the state like the left has done for last 3 decades thats all there is to itbengalis have no hope left its tmc or bjp  and both are cancerous in their own ways only chance is for an arvind kejriwal to rise  but thats probably never gonna happen most educated and literate bengalis are leaving the state  whos gonna rise to the occasion? there should be a trade off between socialism and capitalismsomething in between so everyone can benefit  deleted  nice writeup bro hows the popularity of bjp among bengalis ? i heard they are gaining ground in some spots and local polls  do you think communists supporting the bjp will affect tmc much ? okey lets list pros and cons of mamata and tmcpros 1  mamata is authoritarian but still tmc regime is way more free than the previous cpm rule it was possible to openly post against tmc in social media such open criticism of the government or party was impossible for most people earlier2  rural infrastructure is developed a lot in comparison to previous regime roads are improved a lot3  the police and the government offices are more active4  smaller crimes like eve teasing and theft are reduced in my experience5  the government and the party is secular and not racist  at all which is a big plus point in todays india6  economy of the state is improved7  government officials and police has more power than the previous regime where they were puppets of the local party officecons 1  one woman party and government due to her tendency to control everything her government is full with people who are good for nothing and totally useless she doesnt like people who would argue with her2  her intolerance against opposition3  tmc is full with goons and politicians whose sole aim is to make money by hook or crook4  appeasement of big groups of people for vote yes  not only muslims  she tried to appease every groups who are united enough the all india media do not show her appeasement of hindu matua people who are a big votebank she tried to appease both mullahs and brahmin pandits by offering them money she also gave money to clubs and durga pujas5  various scams like sharada  trifala etc6  state government employees are angry with her due to  not giving da and other allowances at par with the central7  reduction of

singh  about economic mismanagement under the modi government sept 1 2019the state of the economy today is deeply worrying the last quarters gdp growth rate of 5 percent signals that we are in the midst of a prolonged slowdown india has the potential to grow at a much faster rate  but allround mismanagement by the modi government has resulted in this slowdownit is particularly distressing that the manufacturing sectors growth is tottering at 06 percent this makes it very clear that our economy has not yet recovered from the manmade blunders of demonetisation and a hastily implemented gst domestic demand is depressed and consumption growth is at an 18 month low nominal gdp growth is at 15 year lowthere is a gaping hole in tax revenues tax buoyancy remains elusive as businessmen  small and big  are hounded  and tax terrorism continues unabated investor sentiment are in doldrums these are not the foundations for economic recoverythe modi governments policies are resulted in massive jobless growth more than 35 lakh jobs have been lost in the automobile sector alone there will similarly be large scale job losses in the informal sector  hurting our most vulnerable workersrural india is in terrible shape our farmers are not receiving adequate prices and rural incomes have declined the low inflation rate that the modi government likes to showcase comes at the cost of our farmers and their income  by inflicting misery on over 50 percent of indias populationinstitutions are under attack  and their autonomy is being eroded the resilience of the reserve bank will be tested after its record transfer of rupees 176 lakh crore to the government  which claims that it does not have a plan on what it will do with this windfall in addition  the credibility of indias data has come under question under this governmentbudget announcements and rollbacks have shaken the confidence of international investors india has not been able to increase the exports to take advantage of opportunities that have arisen in global trade due to geopolitical realignment such is the state of economic management under the modi governmentour youth  our farmers and our farm workers  entrepreneurs  and the marginalised section deserve better india cannot afford to continue down this path therefore  i urge the government to put aside vendetta politics and reach out to all sane voices and thinking minds to steer our economy out of this manmade crisis whats particularly angering to me is that the bjp listened to all this and then came out and made a completely unrelated and irrelevant attack on dr mms by calling him a puppet of the congress leadershipwhether or not he was  i fail to understand how that is connected to the statement dr mms had made on the economyand then they went ahead and said that the economy is working fine under the modi government i mean like wtf? then why did the rbi transfer an unprecedented 176 lakh crore to the government? why did the fin min rollback some of the budgetary provisions to implement new ones? why is your niti aayog leadership and the economic advisors to the pm affirming that there indeed is a slowdown? why are core sectors performing pathetically? why are factories closing up?matlab  chutiya samaj rakha hai bas literally lying to our faces at least acknowledge that there is a problem solving it comes later in the process  deleted   rural india is in terrible shape our farmers are not receiving adequate prices and rural incomes have declined the low inflation rate that the modi government likes to showcase comes at the cost of our farmers and their income  by inflicting misery on over 50 percent of indias populationto me  this is the single biggest blunder the demo was big but one time blunder whereas  ignoring the farm crisis year on year is an even bigger blunder you cannot say we have managed inflation by putting more than 50 of the population in severe debt and income crisis thats not how you manage inflation and thats exactly why this bjp govt has got the basics of economics wrong and even now  i am afraid that all the subsidies are going to go to industries sure you can artificially increase the production and trade through govt intervention but only for a limited period of time because who would consume what is produced when 50 of the population have had very poor income and are in debt i really really hope that govt invests into the rural market that is the need of the hour but are they listening? mms uses long sentences and uses big words like  tax buoyancy  elusive  he needs to put out statement in eli5 format for folks in bjp to understand if you need this as screenshots  3 images here   https  imgurcom a l1ywsch  https  imgurcom a l1ywsch  if you need a nonreddit link of the text  check my profile useful to share when someone says oh its cyclical  the global economy is slowing down  etcmms says its a manmade disaster and i agree maybe the upa wasnt perfect and benefited from lucky market cycles  like the pre2010 real estate boom   but all weve had since 2014 is pointless marketing campaigns with no followthrough like make in india  startup india  etc  then selfinflicted wounds like demonetisation  hastilyimplemented gst  and all sorts of random regulations and taxes  including extreme margins for the govt on fuel  and businesspeople reporting increased harassment  this is a misery however  i salute modi govt to have steered indians and kept them away from realising these problems by giving them some other bullshit motives to praise him like a hindu rashtra and ordering some airstrike he totally distracted people and still has them distracted from growing problems of unemploymentwhich was already the most serious problem during his 1st termyou have to admit  namo is an expert at marketing himself and still keeping himself in power using things against the people of india which they like the most even among these problems of lack of employment  the people of india too  maybe not those who come here on reddit  but still a lot of them  prefer  achieving a hindu rashtra rather than bringing something home to feed their families its not just namo  its also the people of india namo is just using this gullible nature to his advantage and his propogandaooh la lamamma miaxdall this fooling around with rahul gandhi being an idiotwellto be fairboth leaders have said terribly stupid things in the pastbut nobody ridicules the namo but pounces on raga instantaneously like seriouslyyou think we dont notice that there is no connection in totally ripping apart ragas political image apart and nobody touching you wow this brings me to that airstrikethere was some terrorist activity and whatever action was needed to be taken was taken wouldve been done regardless of who was in power and anyway  the suggestion to conduct an airstrike wouldve been suggested by the head of the iaf  cas  pmo just gives a go to any suggestion it was obviously beneficial to him looking how overtly patriotic our idiotic citizens were becoming another cheap thrill indians love insulting pakistan in whatever way possible as a resultindians loved this activity and there goes namo againand as a matter of facthe steers the crowd so well  that these very people who had a twinkle in their eyes at the thought of acche din have forgotten that those acche din never arrived so fucking awesome that a leader can do this last i knew somebody being this influential was adolf hitler and this is not insulting modi maybe forbes also named him one of the top most influential leaders of the worldbut they dont know what kind of influence you should try triggering people sentimentally by saying something mildly anti modi on a primitive social platform like facebook or whatsapp some platform where a majority of this hindurashtra loving population is  the kind of blind love for namo and the immediate labelling of antinational  endless hate  life threats  rape threats and whatnot this is where you see the true indiathe india that voted bjp in powerin such a scenario  where the government and the citizens focus more on religion than actual livelihood of themselves  the people who want a better life are just stuck here best solution according to me is to escape this country asap and settle at place where your livelihood is not affected and youre away from religious wars and petty politics places like this exist  trust me you just cannot thrive in india and cultivate a good ambitious career here maybe there will come a time where india will plunge so deep down this shithole that itll have to press a hard reset over everything and start afresh maybe some day then itll have a better and educated leader wholl actually take the reigns of this actually glorious country and restore it maybe maybe maybe but this plunging and this reset is far from nearnot happening 12  generations away from me since the current and all future contingents for this leadership are fucked up people itll take some more years to bring this country down just by virtue of its volume since it is so slow  nobody is noticing thats itthis may be sounding a bit antinationalistic but i really think this is where the country is leading and theres no way leaders are mending their ways in the near future to steer away from this messthey only know how to steer away from reality am i the only one who read it in his voice? he has ignored the fact that hindu khatre me hai  s legend when the countrys majority is high af on their drug of choice aka hindutva  such important words of wisdom mean nothing farmers may be distressed now the middle class may be bearing the brunt of modinomics now smes may be feeling the pinch now but come elections  a military op against pakistan or a perfectly timed resurgence of the ram mandir issue in the media or something equally manipulative would immediately turn these same now badly off  economically screwed dildos into loyal bhakts and theyll end up voting for the very same government which annihilated their happiness again thats how powerful this drug is equally destructive is the epidemic caused by it this drug  and those selling it  need to go for this selfinflicted fog of disorientation  chaos and selfdestruction to lift actually  couldnt agree more clearly the government is doing something wrong and it has to revisit its policies without appearing indecisive and why have they increased the road penalties so much? single biggest mistake of indians was to elect narendra modi as prime minister as much as i like dr manmohan singh  it was criminal of upa ii to not impose gst under his watchful eyes bjp and economics well  then why did they give amartya sen a nobel prize for that? any folks here in economics and finance care to elucidate on the situation  both for bjp and what our former pm is saying? o bhai yeh saari chize toh sanjay rajoura bhi bata deta koi solution bhi toh sunao manmohan sahib there will be recession every 10 years because of business cycle govt cannot do anything it is actually harmful to interfere nothing but opportunistic statement from manmohan its ok just blame us chinese  we can take the extra hatejokes aside at least u guys dont see 50 rise in food prices  removed  i bet none of the numb nuts in the govt can explain the terms tax

here goes my storya little about myself im 30 yr old indian woman working in it and earning well i am the only kid and my mother raised me as a single parent after my dad left usshe has raised me to be independent and has given me freedom unlike other indian familiesi had my share of relations when i was young and i was single for a considerable amount of time in mid 20s and i made good use of it i started traveling and over years have come to love it travel opened doors for me in blogging and photography and my friends say i am decent at both being single also taught me value of friendships and im fortunate to have made some solid bonds over the yearsi met my bf  32 yrs  two years ago and with time we realized we do want to spend our lives together as we started talking about future i realized that my bf is very keen to move to his hometown and take over his family business  agriculture  he mentioned it casually once a yr ago i had no idea he was serious about it   i refused to agree for this as it is hard for me to relocate to a place which has zero opportunities for career i hate the idea of staying at home or being dependent for finances for the reasons above and also that i would be giving up all my friends leaving my mom work  travel everything for one person seemed like a bad dealwe tried to come up with solutions but none of them made of us happy and hence agreed for mutual breakup this breakup has left bitter feelings in me about everything i want to stop feeling negative about my ex  somewhere i feel he could have stayed considering he has been staying in the city for 20+ yrs  and stop feeling sad for myself i am scared that i might end up alone given the age taboo caste etc in india and quite not sure how to deal with all the negativity in my headany suggestions are welcomethanks ablahnaari#x200b #x200b  chill dude  no need to worry its better to be alone than with someone with whom youre not comfortable living by yourself has its own advantage   you have time 30 is not that old get back out there when you are ready dont blame yourself  or your ex if you wanted different things in life and had strong convictions about your choices  either one of you would have had to compromise and deal with the resentment that typically follows compromising core beliefs or the relationship would have fallen apart at some point if neither one wants to compromise  if it had to end  its better it ended now and not after you were married and in your late thirties or later give it some time and reevaluate  feelings always clouds reality everyone feels like the universe is conspiring against them after something bad happens time heals most wounds if you let it stay positive i am 33 years old  have never been in a relationship  no marriage proposal seems to work out for myriad reasons  yet i keep faith while also keeping fit  enjoying my life  finding new interests and try to travel as much as i can amidst incredibly heavy pressure from my parents and society last thing one needs is to give in to bullshit societal standards love has no sell by date you mentioned you love to travel  do more of it  its a great distraction plan a trip in the near future travel has healing and transformative powersi wish you all the best  the dude lived in the city for 20+ years and wants to go farm? let him he seems passionate about it  dont hold him backas for you  you are too young to be worried about whats gonna happen to you take it easy and move on  you have no idea whats in store that ablanaari shit was funny though  i am scared that i might end up alone given the age taboo caste etc in india and quite not sure how to deal with all the negativity in my headstop worrying about that crap and work on making yourself a better person pickup some new hobbies hang out with your friends or try making new ones i have to admit that i have not travelled as much as you didbut my only suggestion right now is to pack your bag and leave your home you will get a  better solution as i am pretty sure you will meet up someone who has solutions to all your problems lpt just talk to as many people as possible find new things to do the less you sit and ponder  the better itll be give it time  and then ponder  and let golive life forward  not backwards you took the right longterm decision the blaming  bitterness and sadness for a few months is common convince and coax your mind that you took a good positive longterm decision for the reasons you have yourself mentioned express your thoughts and justifications and plans in some way for me  writing them in detail in a diary worked but if youre not into writing  record an audio or video of yourself discussing it with yourself or if you have a close friend whos a good listener  express it in front of them i dont know the psychology behind why expressing your thoughts to yourself or others actually helps  but it doesas for fear of society  most people dont bother and those who trash talk you can be ignored or even belittled solo life is not bad as you yourself already seem to have explored it quite a bit id suggest getting into any new relationship only for positive reasons  such as love and companionship  and never for negative or shallow reasons  such as fear   reputation   social status  take it from a 24 y o guy  who got cheated multiple times and lost faith in love#x200b smoke a joint  let go off things  and start afresh 30 aint too old you still have a good 45 years before you settle down goodluck and learn to forgive but not forget   30+something  just broke up its very normal to hate your ex even if he she hasnt done anything horrible #x200b be kind to yourself im not a believer in god or spirituality but mindfulness has helped me what are you going through is grief its the same feeling as you would feel if a loved one died you probably already know the 5 stages of grief you are going to go through all of it  not in sequence but in circles give yourself time and be kind to yourself #x200b trust me i went through this  im not out yet  but i am a million times better than what i was immediately after  curious question is the word abla or ablah? i know certain indian demographic ppl like to add h around their ts but cmon why here? i am pretty sure the actual word is ablathankhs", "tokenized": [101, 3631, 2039, 2382,

utter stupid policies this govt has managed to destroy one of the most promising sectors telecom into a duopolyeven liquid funds are crashing hard as even goi defaulting cannot be ruled out at this point lot of rbi money has gone into cleaning up the mess created by demo  gst  saving private banks  etc while other countries are announcing several billion dollars of corona relief  there is nothing really left in terms of relief to indian citizensduring recession  you need actual economists like manmohan singh and raghuram rajan steering the ship  not war mongers like anurag thakur and

budgetnow in the face of a pandemic  things are go to shitknowing politicos as they are  they will probably put up a smokescreen and try to distract over some useless stuffthe only thing india has going for it roght now economically is that the crude oil has crashed while domestic rates have still been kept up through taxes which should help their budgetedit oh yeah and i forgot about the gst

this corona gets over   they will plan to build some big god figure statue to thank on how it saved us from corona and waste more moneycentre now doesnt have to invest time to divert people  they now have corona to hide all thier poor performance and nonsensical decision making on a main note   any suggestion on current market investment ? if at all one decides to enter when markets are down ?  unsurprisingly chaddy gaumutra drinkers dont have any come back to this kind of facts but soldiers are fighting at the err sorry the health care providers are risking their lives to battle this chinese made virus  which btw is a chinese chaal  and you are asking such questions thereby demoralizing the countrywhat you should rather be doing is to clap or bang your thaalis at 5 pm on sunday during janata curfew  which in the interest of nation is going to happen after mp floor test  as congressi and commies are hand in gloves with these cheeni peopleand yes  the govt is fully prepared to handle such or more emergencies  and dare you resist corona cess  like kargil cess  which will be surreptitiously introduced like excise tax increment on fuel and increase in gst on certain products and 5 folds increase on platform tickets it speaks a lot about our economy when indias 4th most popular bank faces problems like this yeah  im not m expecting any improvement in the economy until 2027 even if we have the sense to vote in a non bjp govt in 2024  it will take them a few years to repair the damage what recession?if one does not accept the existence of a problem  then the problem does not existsee s i see lot of trolls and  complaints   can we have productive alternatives to this for 2024 and above ? mera desh badal raha hai ulta chal raha hai dogger modi i agree with what you said just mind well  using a language like dear sanghi morons only divides us further i support no party but  from my observation i feel everyone around me cheers for a political party as if they are football clubs hooligans have a very different mentality  the more you alienate or single them out  the more moronic theyll actproblem is  we keep a party accountable not the position  not the entire body we dont try to regulate and hold public forums to make sure right steps are being taken since fandom drives votes  or hacked evms   people who want progress cant do shitits hard to fix  but unity and making everyone understand the big picture would be your first step not saying moron  if you ever managed large number of teams youd deal with under performers  critics  cynics  go getters   etc  driving a change in such an environment requires openness  collaboration  incremental education and then subsequent lifts once those processes are in place  you feel that those that arent contributing  cynics  people that are negative  etc  realize that their opinion isnt right and they shut up automatically i think thats what our country needs right nowyou bring those morons in your community ask them to help work with you on a cause  test it incrementally and then move towards what works best everyone walks out happy denial is bad thing atleast they could accept things have gone bad its not just indian government the whole world is not prepared for such an incident i personally expected the economic bubble to burst for two years now this time it happened due to a pandemic the repercussions will be extreme and as usual the big businesses will be bailed out by the banks and government the only solution for us indians would be to 1 pay off all debtsmove from a debt economy to a savings based economy the ones that our grandparents followed 2 decentralisationpower and opportunities should not get concentrated in big cities there is pollution  population  lack of resources and chaos we need to distribute industries and opportunities across towns and villages where people will no longer have to move to the city for a job at least we are not being run by scam artistseconomic development  economic growthi hate how you all are willing to go back to the scam era of india downvote me all you want you just support the  evil gandu family i hope you love your dreams of nepotism rip me out all you want  the truth hurts", "tokenized": [101, 16913, 2072, 22410, 3171, 6043, 2031, 2042, 9789, 3238, 2005, 2086, 2634, 2097, 5998, 2524, 2076, 19396, 15222, 2015,

around a few things ama ready to go harsha  heres a difficult one for you rightaway i have often wondered and now i ask you  we know that you are back  but are you really? will it ever be the same again? or will you always have that fear of an impending embargo? it is hard to believe that everything is going to be the same hi  apart from all the cricket questions you will be facingjust wanted to share with you a cool thing i stumbled upon recently i was searching the internet about a true crime case and i came across a random comment on a random true crime blog where the commenter mentioned that she was the daughter of the famous  in his niche at least   rs kulkarni her last name was bhogle  so i googled the name and found out she was indeed your wife it was cool finding out two famous people in two very different fields were related in some wayso to ask a question  do you and your wife discuss about your father in law and his cases? although i know its not for everyone  are you and your wife interested in her fathers work?apart from the published books of your father in law  do you guys have any other material of his thats not confidential?also whats your favourite place in hyderabad thats not related to cricket? any memorable incidents you are willing to share?thanks for doing this ama for anyone interested  rs kulkarni was a dcp of mumbai police when a famous indian serial killer raman raghav was captured and tried for his murders he also handled several other important cases but this was the case through which i came to know about him hi harsha   thanks for doing ama   my question is about ashwin and his consistent poor show in overseas why do you term him a modern legend   in india he picks 5 wkts in every innings but come overseas he goes wicketless in every match   what not give chance to kuldeep yadav or amit mishra i wasnt expecting so many questions and while i would be very happy to answer many more  i need to go somewhere i am sorry i took a little longer to get my head around this but now that i have  maybe i can do it again do leave your questions and i will answer them when i am back thank you very much for your support as i said on twitter  i am often moved by it and it has meant a lot to me cheers and have fun with cricket it is a great sport are you planning to bring back the espn school quiz or a show along similar lines? what is the most memorable moment in your career so far? hello harsha just one curious question how is it like hanging out with rahul dravid?  deleted  what was your oops moment  if any  while in the commentary box ?  hi harsha  thanks for doing this ama what cricketing stat always amazes you? hi harsha  what are your thoughts on ex cricketers being given commentary gigs despite them not being very good at it?   deleted  what is your stance on the whole banning pakistani players from ipl and no individual tours with pakistan thing? thanks nice to see a few of you around trust it is going well trying my best to answer as many as i can do you think jadeja did the right thing by saving himself instead of pandya? this is an ipl question and since you are a hyderabadi   i wanted to ask thishow did you feel when sunrisers hyderabad won ipl 9? hi harsha just wanted to know  i loved your way of commentary  have you ever met sangas dad? hi harsha    while i cant speak for others  id like to say the way you were unceremoniously let go  because of the likes of dhoni  kohli and a film star who shall not be named  couldnt take it on the chin like men  was nothing short of juvenile it really shows the difference between the previous generation and this one ie a lack of class clearly as they say money cant buy classfor all the money  and self aggrandizing showmanship by some of the players today the overt attempts at manliness  there seems to be a real lack of spine when it comes to taking criticism which is not something you could accuse a dravid or a tendulkar of  surely after youve been whitewashed twice in a row  criticism is due all in all its too bad your commentary was a delight to listen to and it made cricket that much more bearable its plainly obvious the bcci is heading towards becoming a feudal good old boys club ps i dont have a specific question  who do you think is the next big gun from the current squad  new players i mean ?", "tokenized": [101, 7632,
